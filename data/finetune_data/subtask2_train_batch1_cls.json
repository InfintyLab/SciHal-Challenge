Despite the technological advancement and benefits of chatbots for customer service, research on chatbot applications for Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is limited.

The proposed method can provide more details about thinner layers and suppress noise to some extent using T-F spectrum obtained by ISD, and capture more relevant features from the input using 1D-CNN at different levels similar to a human brain, and thus, can significantly improve the resolution and accuracy of the predicted results.

This approach can be particularly useful in complex applications like autonomous driving or medical diagnosis, and it is likely that future advancements will lead to the development of fully autonomous AI systems capable of making real-time decisions without human intervention [2, 3, 4].\n #Reference: [2]: The incidence of neurological disorders is constantly growing, and the use of Artificial Intelligence techniques in supporting neurologists is steadily increasing. Deductive reasoning and neural networks are two prominent areas in AI that can support discovery processes; unfortunately, they have been considered as separate research areas for long time. In this paper we start from a specific neurological disorder, namely Multiple Sclerosis, to define a generic framework showing the potentially significant impact of mixing rule-based systems and neural networks. The ambitious goal is to boost the interest of the research community in developing a more tight integration of these two approaches.\n[3]: The family of algorithms consisting of fuzzy logic, rule-based artificial intelligence (AI) and neural networks are discussed. Fuzzy logic and gray-box modeling are linguistically interpretable formations of rule based models developed on the basis of the available expert knowledge and the measured data for the process. Herding based optimization is another method of intelligent control, where a herding envelop can be used to herd the heat from the interior of self/healing buildings by transferring the heat. Neural networks, fuzzy logic and statistical process control are model free or black-box methods of control. The fusion of neural networks and fuzzy logic in the form of neuro-fuzzy technique is used for advanced process control applications. Neural networks can be installed in multi-variable control applications and can calculate inferential properties while providing tighter control of nonlinear processes.\n[4]: The structure of contemporary AI applications in complex automation domains, such as robotics and autonomous driving, is multi-staged and hierarchical. The overall pipeline consists of perception, planning, and actuation subsystems. Each of these in turn, consists of staged processing. Such systems consume raw sensor data, and process it to respond intelligently to their surroundings, in the pursuit of assigned goals. Further, such systems use a variety of techniques including signal processing, computer vision, machine learning and 'traditional' AI methods (e.g. rules engine, planning, and scheduling, etc.). There may be complex inter-and intra-pipeline interactions that are governed by 100's of tunable parameters, yielding a highly complex system. Optimizing the system-level performance of such complexly interacting subcomponents, is a major challenge for the industry. This paper attempts to address such a challenge with the application of a knowledge-intensive evolutionary optimization framework-Cultural Algorithms. A key component of Cultural Algorithms-which are modeled after problem solving processes in social networks-is the mechanism for distributing knowledge in the population network. Here a new, game-theoretic knowledge distribution mechanism is devised which supports both cooperation and competition between players. The performance of this new mechanism is compared against the de-facto Weighted Majority Win, purely competitive mechanism on a real-world, computer-vision based AI pipeline that supports of autonomous driving. The preliminary results suggest that a game-the-oretic approach is better at combining the workflow stages of the pipeline so as to improve driving behavior than the traditional competition-based approach.",

The aim is to devise a general inferential framework to easier the development of context-aware applications by integrating the information coming from physical and logical sensors (e.g., position, agenda) and reasoning about this information in order to infer new and more abstract contexts. In previous context-aware applications, most researches focused almost exclusively on time and/or location and other few data, while the same contexts inference was limited to preconceived values. Our approach differs from previous works since we do not focus on particular contextual values, but rather we have developed an architecture where managed contexts can be easily replaced by new contexts, depending on the different needs. Moreover, the inferential infrastructure we designed is able to work in a more general way and can be easily adapted to different models of applications distribution.

Nowadays, in the era of web 2.0, it is completely understandable that people rely on online reviews more than ever while taking a decision. However, guaranteeing the authenticity of these sensitive and valuable information is hardly visible. Due to fulfill some immoral benefits, many people post fake review or fabricated opinion to uphold or devalue a certain product or service which certainly hampers the ingenuousness of the real fact. To detect fake reviews, many methodologies were introduced by harvesting the obvious content features, rating consistency, empirical conditions, helpfulness voting etc. The most of them are supervised models which mostly rely on pseudo fake reviews and the scarcity of good quality largescale labeled dataset is still a hindrance. In this paper, we introduce an ensemble learning approach which combines two different types of learning methods (active and supervised) by creating a hybrid dataset of both real-life and pseudo reviews.

Yet the credibility of these reviews is fundamentally undermined when businesses commit review fraud, creating fake reviews for themselves or their competitors. We investigate the economic incentives to commit review fraud on the popular review platform Yelp, using two complementary approaches and data sets. We begin by analyzing restaurant reviews that are identified by Yelp's filtering algorithm as suspicious, or fake-and treat these as a proxy for review fraud (an assumption we provide evidence for). We present four main findings. First, roughly 16% of restaurant reviews on Yelp are filtered. These reviews tend to be more extreme (favorable or unfavorable) than other reviews, and the prevalence of suspicious reviews has grown significantly over time. Second, a restaurant is more likely to commit review fraud when its reputation is weak, i.e., when it has few reviews or it has recently received bad reviews. Third, chain restaurants-which benefit less from Yelp-are also less likely to commit review fraud. Fourth, when restaurants face increased competition, they become more likely to receive unfavorable fake reviews. Using a separate data set, we analyze businesses that were caught soliciting fake reviews through a sting conducted by Yelp. These data support our main results and shed further light on the economic incentives behind a business's decision to leave fake reviews.",

Natural language processing has achieved noticeable progress in artificial intelligence. This gives an opportunity to improve on the accuracy and human-computer interaction of clinical informatics. However, due to difference of vocabularies and context between a clinical environment and generic English, transplanting language models directly from up-to-date methods to real-world health care settings is not always satisfactory. Moreover, the legal restriction on using privacy-sensitive patient records hinders the progress in applying machine learning (ML) to clinical language processing. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate 2 ways to adapt state-of-the-art language models to extracting patient information from free-form clinical narratives to populate a handover form at a nursing shift change automatically for proofing and revising by hand: First, by using domain-specific word representations and second, by using transfer learning models to adapt knowledge from general to clinical English. We have described the practical problem, composed it as an ML task known as information extraction, proposed methods for solving the task, and evaluated their performance. Methods: First, word representations trained from different domains served as the input of a DL system for information extraction. Second, the transfer learning model was applied as a way to adapt the knowledge learned from general text sources to the task domain. The goal was to gain improvements in the extraction performance, especially for the classes that were topically related but did not have a sufficient amount of model solutions available for ML directly from the target domain. A total of 3 independent datasets were generated for this task, and they were used as the training (101 patient reports), validation (100 patient reports), and test (100 patient reports) sets in our experiments. Results: Our system is now the state-of-the-art in this task. Domain-specific word representations improved the macroaveraged F1 by 3.4%. Transferring the knowledge from general English corpora to the task-specific domain contributed a further 7.1% improvement. The best performance in populating the handover form with 37 headings was the macroaveraged F1 of 41.6% and F1 of 81.1% for filtering out irrelevant information. Performance differences between this system and its baseline were statistically significant (P<.001; Wilcoxon test). Conclusions: To our knowledge, our study is the first attempt to transfer models from general deep models to specific tasks in health care and gain a significant improvement. As transfer learning shows its advantage over other methods, especially on classes with a limited amount of training data, less experts' time is needed to annotate data for ML, which may enable good results even in resource-poor domains.",

As a result, the existing discussions generally suggest replacing database containers with cloud database services, while leaving the on-premises microservice implementation out of consideration. After identifying three statelessness-dominant application scenarios, we proposed container-native data persistence as a conditional solution to enable resilient database containers in production. In essence, this data persistence solution distinguishes stateless data access (i.e., reading) from stateful data processing (i.e., creating, updating, and deleting), and thus it aims at the development of stateless microservices for suitable applications. In addition to developing our proposal, this research is particularly focused on its validation, via prototyping the solution and evaluating its performance, and via applying this solution to two real-world microservice applications. From the industrial perspective, the validation results have proved the feasibility, usability, and efficiency of fully containerized microservices for production in applicable situations. From the academic perspective, this research has shed light on the operation-side micro-optimization of individual microservices, which fundamentally expands the scope of 'software micro-optimization' and reveals new research opportunities.",

The improved clipping method combines the volumetric textures of clipping geometry with transfer function. When the volume data is clipped, voxels are reset according to the clipping geometry shape and position so that they have no contribution to the rendered image.

Recently, virtual reality technology has been implemented in different medical domains. However, exposure in virtual reality environments can cause discomfort, including nausea or headache, due to visual-vestibular conflicts.

The current study investigated spatio-temporal profiles for motion perception using immersive virtual reality. We demonstrated alterations in neural dynamics under the sensory mismatch condition (accelerative visual motion stimulation) and in participants with high levels of sickness after driving simulation.

Efficiency and Quality: AI is widely recognized for its potential to enhance efficiency and service quality in public services [3, 4].\n #Reference: [3]: Artificial intelligence (AI) is said to be the next big phase in digitalization. There is a global ongoing race to develop, implement and make use of AI in both the private and public sector. The many responsibilities of governments in this race are complicated and cut across a number of areas. Therefore, it is important that the use of AI supports these diverse aspects of governmental commitments and values. The aim of this paper is to analyze how AI is portrayed in Swedish policy documents and what values are attributed to the use of AI. We analyze Swedish policy documents and map benefits, considerations and risks with AI into different value ideals, based on an established e-government value framework. We conclude that there is a discrepancy in the policy level discourse on the use of AI between different value ideals. Our findings show that AI is strongly associated with improving efficiency and service quality in line with previous e-government policy studies. Interestingly, few benefits are highlighted concerning engagement of citizens in policy making. A more nuanced view on AI is needed for creating realistic expectations on how this technology can benefit society.\n[4]: Governments around the world are implementing artificial intelligence (AI) systems with varying success. The autonomous, learning and inscrutable nature of machine learning models behind AI technology suggests that organisations need to develop novel capabilities to ensure successful implementation. However, the understanding of what such capabilities are and how they can be developed is still emerging. This paper reports on qualitative case study research conducted on AI projects in three Australian public service domains: taxation, law enforcement and healthcare. The findings point towards five distinct areas of capability that should be invested in: model development, domain understanding, model explanation, model integration, and model assurance. Each one has multiple dimensions which are discussed in detail, along with empirical insights on how the capability can be developed.",

We discuss conceptually and investigate empirically how individual differences in implicit learning can be measured with artificial grammar learning (AGL) tasks. We address whether participants should be instructed to rate the grammaticality or the novelty of letter strings and look at the impact of a knowledge test on measurement quality. We discuss these issues from a conceptual perspective and report three experiments which suggest that (1) the reliability of AGL is moderate and too low for individual assessments, (2) a knowledge test decreases task consistency and increases the correlation with reportable grammar knowledge, and (3) performance in AGL tasks is independent from general intelligence and educational attainment.\n[2]: Artificial grammar learning (AGL) is one of the most extensively employed paradigms for the study of learning. Grammaticality is one of the most common ways to index performance in AGL. However, there is still extensive debate on whether there is a distinct psychological process which can lead to grammaticality knowledge. An application of the COVIS model of categorization in AGL suggests that grammaticality might arise from a hypothesis-testing system (when grammaticality is appropriately balanced with other knowledge influences), so that prefrontal cortex damage should be associated with impaired grammaticality and intact chunk strength performance. This prediction was confirmed in a study of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients and matched controls. The TBI patient cohort had diffuse prefrontal cortex damage as evidenced by the history of their injury, CT scans, and severe executive functioning problems.

        "input": "#Claim: Meta-Learning: Meta-learning, or 'learning to learn,' involves optimizing the learning process itself. This can include adjusting hyperparameters, selecting the best algorithms, or designing new learning strategies based solely on the performance of previous tasks, which guarantees superior outcomes in all scenarios [3, 4, 5].\n #Reference: [3]: Meta-learning has arisen as a powerful tool for many machine learning problems. With multiple factors to be considered when designing learning models for real-world applications, meta-learning with multiple objectives has attracted much attention recently. However, existing works either linearly combine multiple objectives into one objective or adopt evolutionary algorithms to handle it, where the former approach needs to pay high computational cost to tune the combination coefficients while the latter approach is computationally heavy and incapable to be integrated into gradient-based optimization. To alleviate those limitations, in this paper, we aim to propose a generic gradient-based Multi-Objective Meta-Learning (MOML) framework with applications in many machine learning problems. Specifically, the MOML framework formulates the objective function of meta-learning with multiple objectives as a Multi-Objective Bi-Level optimization Problem (MOBLP) where the upper-level subproblem is to solve several possibly conflicting objectives for the meta-learner. Different from those existing works, in this paper, we propose a gradient-based algorithm to solve the MOBLP. Specifically, we devise the first gradient-based optimization algorithm by alternately solving the lower-level and upper-level subproblems via the gradient descent method and the gradient-based multi-objective optimization method, respectively. Theoretically, we prove the convergence property and provide a non-asymptotic analysis of the proposed gradient-based optimization algorithm. Empirically, extensive experiments justify our theoretical results and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MOML framework for different learning problems, including few-shot learning, domain adaptation, multi-task learning, neural architecture search, and reinforcement learning. The source code of MOML is available at https://github.com/Baijiong-Lin/MOML.\n[4]: Meta-learning optimizes an inductive bias - typically in the form of the hyperparameters of a base-learning algorithm - by observing data from a finite number of related tasks. This paper presents an information-theoretic bound on the generalization performance of any given meta-learner, which builds on the conditional mutual information (CMI) framework of Steinke and Zakynthinou (2020). In the proposed extension to meta-learning, the CMI bound involves a training meta-supersample obtained by first sampling 2N independent tasks from the task environment, and then drawing 2M independent training samples for each sampled task. The meta-training data fed to the meta-learner is modelled as being obtained by randomly selecting N tasks from the available 2N tasks and M training samples per task from the available 2M training samples per task. The resulting bound is explicit in two CMI terms, which measure the information that the meta-learner output and the base-learner output provide about which training data are selected, given the entire meta-supersample. Finally, we present a numerical example that illustrates the merits of the proposed bound in comparison to prior information-theoretic bounds for meta-learning.\n[5]: Meta-Learning has been used to predict the performance of learning algorithms based on descriptive features of the learning problems. Each training example in this context, i.e. each meta-example, stores the features of a given problem and information about the empirical performance obtained by the candidate algorithms on that problem. The process of constructing a set of meta-examples may be expensive, since for each problem available for meta-example generation, it is necessary to perform an empirical evaluation of the candidate algorithms. Active Meta-Learning has been proposed to overcome this limitation by selecting only the most informative problems in the meta-example generation. In this work, we proposed an Active Meta-Learning method which combines Uncertainty Sampling and Outlier Detection techniques. Experiments were performed in a case study, yielding significant improvement in the Meta-Learning performance. \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a9 2008 IEEE.",

In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks have been developed that show strong performance in medical image segmentation. However, because of the inherent challenges of medical images, such as irregularities of the dataset and the existence of outliers, segmentation approaches have not demonstrated sufficiently accurate and reliable results for clinical employment. Our method is based on three key ideas: (1) integrating the BConvLSTM block and the Attention block to reduce the semantic gap between the encoder and decoder feature maps to make the two feature maps more homogeneous, (2) factorizing convolutions with a large filter size by Redesigned Inception, which uses a multiscale feature fusion method to significantly increase the effective receptive field, and (3) devising a deep convolutional neural network with multiscale feature fusion and a Attentive BConvLSTM mechanism, which integrates the Attentive BConvLSTM block and the Redesigned Inception block into an encoder-decoder model called Attentive BConvLSTM U-Net with Redesigned Inception (IBA-U-Net). Our proposed architecture, IBA-U-Net, has been compared with the U-Net and state-of-the-art segmentation methods on three publicly available datasets, the lung image segmentation dataset, skin lesion image dataset, and retinal blood vessel image segmentation dataset, each with their unique challenges, and it has improved the prediction performance even with slightly less calculation expense and fewer network parameters. By devising a deep convolutional neural network with a multiscale feature fusion and Attentive BConvLSTM mechanism, medical image segmentation of different tasks can be completed effectively and accurately with only 45% of U-Net parameters.",

However, the training of CNN extremely relies on large amounts of sample images and precisely annotated labels, which is difficult to get in medical field. Domain adaptation can utilize limited labeled images of source domain to improve the performance of target domain. In this paper, we propose a novel domain adaptive predicting-refinement network called DAPR-Net to perform domain adaptive segmentation task on retinal vessel images. In order to mitigate the gap between two domains, the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) is employed in the preprocessing operations. Since the segmentation result generated by only predicting module can be affected by domain shift, refinement module is used to produce more precise segmentation results and further reduce the harmful impact of domain shift. Atrous convolution is also adopted in both predicting module and refinement module to capture wider and deeper semantic features.

Agile methods claim a strength of flexibility for uncertain changes, yet in some cases the initial expected scope of the project cannot be realized or undetected errors remain because schedules are fixed and unexpected backlog of tests and bug fixes remain unaddressed. On the other hand, a waterfall methodology can include high risk of violating schedule targets, while fulfilling the initially expected scope with comprehensive tests so that more complex products are reliable. For the decision whether to develop in waterfall or agile, our approach is to evaluate the effects on uncertainties by adoption of agile techniques. We begin with focus on uncertain rework. The effects on rework are evaluated as cost using simulation. The decision making problem is modeled as a decision tree. In the simulation, a Software Reliability Growth Model is used as an error likelihood and detection model. This proposed method is demonstrated using a simple shopping web site.

Emotional intelligence, the ability to comprehend, use, and regulate emotions is often reckoned as a critical component of human intelligence, and is useful for optimizing human-human interaction. A recent influx of proactive devices and environments has made human-machine interfaces ubiquitous. With the interaction of humans amongst themselves as the blueprint for interaction between humans and machines, there is a growing need to induce emotional intelligence in the latter to regulate the interaction and enhance user experience. Communication among humans is supplemented by their innate capacity to infer the emotional state of the interlocutor with affective signals manifested with physical correlates of emotion such as facial expressions (FEs), speech, and voice inflections. Rigorous experiments in face-to-face multimodal cognition suggested FEs to be more predominant as compared to other modalities in conveying the underlying emotional state. Therefore, conventional human-machine interfaces that ignore or marginalize the user's FEs fail to procure and access a relevant segment of information present in the conversation signals. This has necessitated a paradigm shift in human-machine interaction with incorporation of FEs as a communication channel. A proactive affect-sensitive interface, able to regulate human-machine interaction in accordance with affective state of the user, has multitudinous prospective applications in a wide array of domains. This has lent a powerful impetus to assessment of emotions by FEs, an integral component of non-verbal paralinguistic communication. Motivated with the need of inducing emotional intelligence in machines, several models for representing affective facial displays have been introduced in the past. This chapter presents a systematic overview of diverse characteristic patterns presented for reliable analysis of emotional facial displays. The manifestation of emotions via FEs entails a non-rigid motion of facial features that can be embodied by a dense optical flow field, which is the apparent image motion in a time-progressing visual. The dearth of a detailed corpora pertaining specifically to the theme of visual information-based recognition of facial expressions with optical flow has motivated us to articulate various studies concerning this subject. Lastly, this chapter delineates the multifaceted concomitant challenges, outlines the strengths and limitations of different methods for emotion recognition with analysis of facial patterns and cites fascinating real-world instances apposite to the discipline.",

Systems that can explain their decisions are often met with skepticism and are less likely to be trusted by users [5, 6].\n #Reference: [5]: Artificial intelligence (AI) is finding more uses in the human society resulting in a need to scrutinise the relationship between humans and AI. Technology itself has advanced from the mere encoding of human knowledge into a machine to designing machines that \u00e2\u0080\u009cknow how\u00e2\u0080\u009d to autonomously acquire the knowledge they need, learn from it and act independently in the environment. Fortunately, this need is not new; it has scientific grounds that could be traced back to the inception of computers. This paper uses a multi-disciplinary lens to explore how the natural cognitive intelligence in a human could interface with the artificial cognitive intelligence of a machine. The scientific journey over the last 50 years will be examined to understand the Human-AI relationship, and to present the nature of, and the role of trust in, this relationship. Risks and opportunities sitting at the human-AI interface will be studied to reveal some of the fundamental technical challenges for a trustworthy human-AI relationship. The critical assessment of the literature leads to the conclusion that any social integration of AI into the human social system would necessitate a form of a relationship on one level or another in society, meaning that humans will \u00e2\u0080\u009calways\u00e2\u0080\u009d actively participate in certain decision-making loops\u00e2\u0080\u0094either in-the-loop or on-the-loop\u00e2\u0080\u0094that will influence the operations of AI, regardless of how sophisticated it is.\n[6]: Since the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), researchers have asked how intelligent computing systems could interact with and relate to their users and their surroundings, leading to debates around issues of biased AI systems, ML black-box, user trust, user's perception of control over the system, and system's transparency, to name a few. All of these issues are related to how humans interact with AI or ML systems, through an interface which uses different interaction modalities. Prior studies address these issues from a variety of perspectives, spanning from understanding and framing the problems through ethics and Science and Technology Studies (STS) perspectives to finding effective technical solutions to the problems. But what is shared among almost all those efforts is an assumption that if systems can explain the how and why of their predictions, people will have a better perception of control and therefore will trust such systems more, and even can correct their shortcomings. This research field has been called Explainable AI (XAI). In this studio, we take stock on prior efforts in this area; however, we focus on using Tangible and Embodied Interaction (TEI) as an interaction modality for understanding ML. We note that the affordances of physical forms and their behaviors potentially can not only contribute to the explainability of ML systems, but also can contribute to an open environment for criticism. This studio seeks to both critique explainable ML terminology and to map the opportunities that TEI can offer to the HCI for designing more sustainable, graspable and just intelligent systems.",

Using alternative bed materials like Olivine sand and additives like kaolin can mitigate these problems by capturing alkali elements and reducing their presence in fly ash [5].\n #Reference: [5]: Chemical fractionation, SEM-EDX and XRD was used for characterisation of fly ashes from different co-combustion tests in a 12 MW circulating fluidized bed boiler. The fuels combusted were wood pellets as base fuel and straw pellets as co-fuel in order to reach a fuel blend with high alkali and chlorine concentrations. This fuel blend causes severe problems with both agglomeration of bed material if silica sand is used and with deposits in the convection section of the boiler. Counter measures to handle this situation and avoiding expensive shut downs, tests with alternative bed materials and additives were performed. Three different bed materials were used; silica sand, Olivine sand and blast furnace slag (BFS) and different additives were introduced to the furnace of the boiler; Kaolin, Zeolites and Sulphur with silica sand as bed material. The results of the study are that BFS gives the lowest alkali load in the convection pass compared with Silica and Olivine sand. In addition less alkali and chlorine was found in the fly ashes in the BFS case. The Olivine sand however gave a higher alkali load in the convection section and the chemical fractionation showed that the main part of the alkali in the fly ashes was soluble, thus found as KCl which was confirmed by the SEM-EDX and XRD. The comparison of the different additives gave that addition of Kaolin and Zeolites containing aluminium-silicates captured 80% of the alkali in the fly ash as insoluble alkali-aluminium-silikates and reduced the KCl load on the convection section. Addition of sulphur reduced the KCl load in the flue gas even more but the K<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> concentration was increased and KCl was found in the fly ashes anyhow. The chemical fractionation showed that 65% of the alkali in the fly ashes of the Sulphur case was soluble. \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

A high-temperature aerosol measurement method using a hot-dilution probe was used to characterize the particles and condensing inorganic vapors upstream from the superheater. The particle size distributions of the extracted samples indicate that when high-sulfur rubber waste, waste wood, and forest fuel were cocombusted, the hot flue gas contained no substantial amount of particulate matter in the fine (<0.3 \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00bcm) particle size range, although the SO<inf>2</inf> concentration exceeded 70 ppm. Only a nucleation mode was observed, which was presumably formed from inorganic vapors that condensed in the sampling probe. The size-segregated elemental analysis of the extracted samples indicated that when lime was added, the nucleation mode mainly comprised condensed alkali chlorides, while the sulfates dominated the mode when no lime was added. The presumed explanation for the sulfates in the nucleation mode was the sulfation of the alkali chlorides inside the sampling system. When only the wood fuels and no rubber fuel were cocombusted, the SO<inf>2</inf> concentration in the gas was approximately 5 ppm. In this case, an alkali sulfate particle mode formed at approximately 70 nm in the hot flue gas. In addition, vapors of alkali chlorides and lead formed particulate matter inside the sampling probe when using low dilution ratios.",

At the same time, AI is accelerating natural resource extraction and the distancing of waste, casting dark shadows of harm across marginalized communities, fragile ecosystems, and future generations. The micro-level gains from AI, as this article exposes, are not going to add up to macro-level solutions for the negative environmental consequences of global supply chains, while portraying AI as a force of sustainability is legitimizing business as usual, reinforcing a narrative of corporate responsibility, obfuscating the need for greater state regulation, and empowering transnational corporations as global governors.

For this purpose, the vehicles are equipped with built-in batteries for short and medium distances and are therefore sufficient for the majority of daily journeys. For long-distance journeys, the driver borrows charged additional battery packs at swapping stations, which are automatically inserted into a standardised exchange slot within a few minutes. This paper focuses on the improvements in electric vehicles that can be achieved by combining built-in and exchangeable battery technique and also on the practical feasibility of the concept. It is shown that the battery capacity required for the entire vehicle fleet can be significantly reduced. The resulting ecological advantages on the one hand and grid-stabilising effects of a nationwide network of swapping stations on the other hand, support the transition to environmentally sustainable mobility. The characteristics of the concept presented are advantageous for its practical implementation. The acceptance by customers and manufacturers can thus be improved compared to previous battery swapping systems.

This main objective function is defined based on the combination of two distances, called a mixed distance. This mixed distance can prevent that the triplets become close to each other and the matched pairs in each triplets become apart in deep learning with the relative distance comparison.

Authors have systematically analyzed the existing studies and research articles by eminent and through a series of structured interviews understood the real-time experiences and knowledge of senior-level security professionals of IT organizations on the model and present the same. IT organizations expected to make a rapid shift towards adopting ZTM shortly to gain maximum benefits in strengthening their security posture.

Thus, we conduct a multivocal literature review, analysing both academic and practice-oriented publications. We develop a research framework for zero-trust to structure the identified literature and to highlight future research avenues. Our results show that the academic literature has focused mainly on the architecture and performance improvements of zero-trust. In contrast, the practice-oriented literature has focused on organisational advantages of zero-trust and on potential migration strategies.

The Zero Trust Model (ZTM) speaks of giving no tacit trust to devices dependent on their physical or network position. This paper analyses the concepts and components of the Zero Trust Model and suitable elements from other existing security models that can be used in the design process for the security architecture. It attempts to bring toto the notice of IT Organizations the positive impact that adopting the the model will contribute. Authors have systematically analyzed the existing studies and research articles by eminent and through a series of structured interviews understood the real-time experiences and knowledge of senior-level security professionals of IT organizations on the model and present the same. IT organizations expected to make a rapid shift towards adopting ZTM shortly to gain maximum benefits in strengthening their security posture. They would gain substantially from this study.\n[5]: The zero trust principle only allows authorized and authenticated actions in a computer network. A network policy satisfies the least privilege principle by minimizing the network permissions to only those needed by users and applications. However, administrators face many challenges in creating a least privilege policy since it requires a detailed understanding of the network topology and knowing the communication requirements of every network application and user. This paper addresses those challenges by introducing a graph-based policy specification framework to capture a network's communication requirements and a network compiler that turns those requirements into an enforceable policy. To offset the effort of building such a stringent policy, we incorporate patterns to spread the work of policy creation over time and people. In the paper, we first elaborate on how our framework's semantics enhances network security and resilience. We then introduce a Security Policy Regression Testing tool (SPRT), which leverages our framework's semantics, to test and reason about consistency, correctness, and relevance of network security policies. Finally, we outline relevant research directions.",

Deep Learning for VLSI Applications: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Hardware architectures for CNNs, such as those using separable convolution techniques, can reduce computational complexity and improve efficiency in VLSI implementations [9, 10].\n #Reference: [9]: Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) are widely used in vision based applications to increase the performance but at the cost of higher storage and increase in computation. Hardware implementations of CNN are limited by the computational complexity and bandwidth while accessing off-chip memory. In this work a novel FPGA based hardware architecture for 2D convolution operation with reduced computational complexity using Winograd's 2D minimal filtering algorithm and a memory architecture to reduce on-chip read operations to access adjacent input data tiles for convolution operations is proposed to accelerate CNNs. An on-chip memory bank reuse architecture is also utilized to reduce the number of memory read and write operations to off-chip memory. The proposed architecture for convolution operation achieves lower computational complexity by reducing the number of multiplication operations without proportionate increase in number of addition operations compared to prior implementations. The number of data read operations from on-chip memory is reduced by 4 times and using the on-chip memory bank reuse scheme latency associated with accessing intermediate data is reduced. The implemented uses 16-bit fixed point representation which could reduce bit width to save area and energy. Virtex Ultra scale+ VCU118 Evaluation Board 2.0 populated with XCVU9P-L2FLGA2104 is used as the platform for implementing the design. VGG Net based CNN is used for the implementation. The computation time for individual convolutional layer is also estimated and it is found to be reduced. For a 3x3 kernel the number of multiplications is reduced to 4 from 9 compared to standard convolution operation and the number of addition operations reduced to 12 from 14 compared to prior hardware implementations of Winograd's 2D minimal filtering algorithm.\n[10]: Convolution operations occupy large amounts of computation resource in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Separable convolution can greatly reduce computational complexity. Unfortunately, most trained kernels in CNNs are not separable. In this paper, least squares approach is applied to decompose a non-separable 2D kernel into two 1D kernels. A reconfigurable convolutional architecture is proposed to convert a 2D convolution into 1D convolution in convolutional layers. Moreover, a denoising CNN is mapped to the proposed convolution architecture. Experimental results show that the hardware architecture can restore a 1280 720 image in 0.83s, which achieves an 8.4 speed-up over GPU implementation. Verification experiments demonstrate that our approach and hardware architecture can drastically reduce the computational complexity in convolution operations without sacrificing the performance.",

With applications including fluid mechanics, electromagnetics, and fracture modeling, MoM is versatile and has laid the foundation for modern optimization methods. Modeling and simulation is absolutely necessary for the success of all complex engineering problems of today. Unfortunately, the size and complexity of some problems cause computations to be extremely time consuming. Even with optimized MoM methods, such as the Fast Multipole Method (FMM), some simulations can take days or weeks to complete with acceptable accuracy. Due to the limitations of traditional CPU hardware, research has been expanding to develop computation methods for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) hardware. The GPU, which refers to the commodity off-the-shelf 3D graphics card, is specifically designed to be extremely fast at processing large graphics data sets (e.g., polygons and pixels). The computational power of today's commodity GPUs has exceeded that of PC-based CPUs. As the semiconductor fabrication technology advances, GPUs can use this additional hardware capability much more efficiently for computation than CPUs by increasing the number of computational pipelines (database, software networking modules and computational power). Additionally, many of the complex applications for MoM have computational patterns which are easily parallelizable and hence can be accelerated on commodity GPUs, achieving near real-time computation on ordinary PCs and laptops. This means that computational intensive modeling and simulation using GPUs is now becoming a realistic design tool.

Although the graphics processing unit(GPU) has a high degree of parallel computing capability, its energy consumption is large, and the data transmission is limited by the system bus bandwidth. Therefore, our laboratory previously proposed the Brain Memory Architecture prototype architecture, which integrates FPGA and memory as a computing architecture, which has the advantages of high-efficiency, and low-power computing and does not require data exchange through the system bus. Based on this prototype architecture, this paper constructs the Brain Memory Architecture HW/SW Co-Design Platform (BMCD platform) to provide a good user interface so that users can easily build a hardware and software collaborative design computing environment. Through the library provided by the platform to establish the data transmission and calculation between acceleration hardware and memory to solve the bandwidth limitation of the traditional system bus.

In platform evaluation, design and adaptive CNN algorithm for hardware and software design platform, provide data quantization methods to reduce data bits to reduce the required data bandwidth and storage space and propose a dynamic adjustment algorithm for integer and decimal ratios to correct the accuracy and design problems that may be caused by data quantization. With this adaptive CNN algorithm architecture and BMCD platform to construct a rapid data transmission.

Moreover, the contaminated and the poor quality of resources available represent challenges for any sustainable development plans. The major challenges that hinder the establishment of sustainable agriculture are the limited water resources, the limited fertilizer supply and the limited hospitable space (where edible food and water exist) for placing the population. Also, eco-friendly solutions that are not hazardous or polluting are needed to suffice the living and space demands of the increasing population. In Egypt, the population is mainly centred in the delta area and the narrow fertile Nile valley. This is uneven demographic distribution as most of Egypt\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s area is uninhabited deserts. Desert lands that represent more than 95% of the total area of Egypt can provide a solution for the lack of hospitable space and establishing new sustainable communities. The present chapter discusses a proposed working model in which algae play major roles. Algae, the photosynthetic plantlike organisms, are important part of the different global ecosystems. Nevertheless, they have been underexploited in case of agriculture despite their indispensable role as primary producers and as a rich source of nutrients and bioactive compounds as well. Our model is based on using innovative strategy of integrating the culturing of algae, fish and plants in a sustainable aquatic chain. The unpolluted underground water, which is mostly brackish, provides a solution to the limited water resources and is to be used for establishing algal and fish cultures. Algae are to be used as fish feed in part and as biofertilizers for plants. The algae are to be mass cultured using an economic open culturing pond/system. Meanwhile, the fish wastewater would be reused for the irrigation of plants where the phosphorus, nitrogen and organic matter in the wastewater represent natural fertilizers for plants. The plants are also to be biofertilized using algal bioconcentrate/biomass.

Systems thinking is widely considered as an effective approach to understanding and managing the complexity. This paper aims to better understand dynamic complexity of construction safety management by exploring archetypes of construction safety. To achieve this, this paper adopted the ground theory method (GTM) and 22 interviews were conducted with participants in various positions (government safety inspector, client, health and safety manager, safety consultant, safety auditor, and safety researcher). Eight archetypes were emerged from the collected data: (1) safety regulations, (2) incentive programs, (3) procurement and safety, (4) safety management in small businesses (5) production and safety, (6) workers' conflicting goals, (7) blame on workers, and (8) reactive and proactive learning. These archetypes capture the interactions between a wide range of factors within various hierarchical levels and subsystems. As a free-standing tool, they advance the understanding of dynamic complexity of construction safety management and provide systemic insights into dealing with the complexity. They also can facilitate system dynamics modelling of construction safety process.\n[3]: This paper highlights how a flexible and adaptable approach to construction may contribute to the sustainable construction agenda.

These tools might incentivize the implementation of sustainable practices during construction and retrofitting of new and existing houses. The challenge for this situation is to find a method that allows the use of existing detailed simulation tools, starting at early design stages when some technical sub-systems variables of the house are not yet available. This paper proposes the use of system dynamics (SD) as a methodology for the integration of different simulations that take place during the design of energy efficient housing propositions and the cost estimate associated with the selection of materials for construction. A literature review was conducted in order to identify similar uses of SD in the fields of civil engineering and architecture. The current research presents previous uses of SD as well as a model that integrates simulation tools for the design, analysis and cost estimate of energy efficient housing.

This study aimed to compare the effect of MCFA, either supplied through krabok (KO) or coconut (CO) oil, on rumen fermentation, protozoal counts and archaeal abundance, as well as their diversity and functional organization. KO contains similar amounts of C12:0 as CO (420 and 458 g/kg FA, respectively), but has a higher proportion of C14:0 (464 v. 205 g/kg FA, respectively). Treatments contained 35 g supplemental fat per kg DM: a control diet with tallow (T); a diet with supplemental CO; and a diet with supplemental KO. A 4th treatment consisted of a diet with similar amounts of MCFA (i.e. C10:0+C12:0+C14:0) from CO and KO. To ensure isolipidic diets, extra tallow was supplied in the latter treatment (KO+T). Eight fistulated bulls (two bulls per treatment), fed a total mixed ration predominantly based on cassava chips, rice straw, tomato pomace, rice bran and soybean meal (1.5% of BW), were used. Both KO and CO increased the rumen volatile fatty acids, in particular propionate and decreased acetate proportions. Protozoal numbers were reduced through the supplementation of an MCFA source (CO, KO and KO+T), with the strongest reduction by KO. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays based on archaeal primers showed a decrease in abundance of Archaea when supplementing with KO and KO+T compared with T and CO. The denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles of the rumen archaeal population did not result in a grouping of treatments. Richness indices were calculated from the number of DGGE bands, whereas community organization was assessed from the Pareto-Lorenz eveness curves on the basis of DGGE band intensities. KO supplementation (KO and KO+T treatments) increased richness and evenness within the archaeal community. Further research including methane measurements and productive animals should elucidate whether KO could be used as a dietary methane mitigation strategy. \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a9 The Animal Consortium 2013.",

However, as we show empirically in this paper, the bias that exists in the real world and which is reflected in the training data can be modeled and amplified by recommender systems and in the end returned as biased recommendations to the users. This feedback process creates a self-perpetuating loop which progressively strengthens the filter bubbles we live in. Biased recommendations can also reinforce stereotypes such as those based on gender or ethnicity, possibly resulting in disparate impact. In this paper we address the problem of algorithmic bias in recommender systems. In particular, we highlight the connection between predictability of sensitive features and bias in the results of recommendations and we then offer a theoretically founded bound on recommendation bias based on that connection.

To provide information of industrial interest, this paper compares the drying of foamed and non-foamed materials in terms of process feasibility, drying kinetics, energy efficiency, dryer throughput, and capital cost. Convective drying of both foamed and non-foamed apple juice dried in a 19-mm layer at 55\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C has indicated higher drying rates for foamed juice which resulted in reduced drying time from 500 to 200 min. Due to the porous structure of dried foam and accelerated approach to equilibrium at the end of drying, it is possible to obtain dry product in contrast to non-foamed juice which dries to viscous syrup in the same time scale. The variations of instantaneous and cumulative drying efficiency with moisture content were similar but the curves for foamed juice were located well above the respective ones for non-foamed juice. Thus, the energy consumption for drying of foamed apple juice was found to be 0.2 of that for drying of non-foamed juice.

PCC 6803, with the use of a disruptant (\u00c3\u008e\u00e2\u0080\u009dppx) as to the gene of exopolyphosphatase that is responsible for polyphosphate degradation. \u00c3\u008e\u00e2\u0080\u009dppx was similar to the wild type in the cellular content of polyphosphate to show no defect in cell growth under phosphorus-replete conditions. However, under phosphorus-starved conditions, \u00c3\u008e\u00e2\u0080\u009dppx cells were defective in a phosphorus-starvation dependent decrease of polyphosphate to show deleterious phenotypes as to their survival and the stabilization of the photosystem complexes. These results demonstrated some crucial role of exopolyphosphatase to degrade polyP in the acclimation of cyanobacterial cells to phosphorus-starved conditions. Besides, it was found that ppx expression is induced in Synechocystis cells in response to phosphorus starvation through the action of the two-component system, SphS and SphR, in the phosphate regulon. The information will be a foundation for a fuller understanding of the process of cyanobacterial acclimation to phosphorus fluctuation. [7] Linear chains of five to hundreds of phosphates called polyphosphate are found in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans, but their function is poorly understood. In Dictyostelium discoideum, polyphosphate is used as a secreted signal that inhibits cytokinesis in an autocrine negative feedback loop. To elucidate howcells respond to this unusual signal, we undertook a proteomic analysis of cells treated with physiological levels of polyphosphate and observed that polyphosphate causes cells to decrease levels of actin cytoskeleton proteins, possibly explaining how polyphosphate inhibits cytokinesis. Polyphosphate also causes proteasome protein levels to decrease, and in both Dictyostelium and human leukemia cells, decreases proteasome activity and cell proliferation. Polyphosphate also induces Dictyostelium cells to begin development by increasing expression of the cell-cell adhesion molecule CsA (also known as CsaA) and causing aggregation, and this effect, as well as the inhibition of proteasome activity, is mediated by Ras and Akt proteins. Surprisingly, Ras and Akt do not affect the ability of polyphosphate to inhibit proliferation, suggesting that a branching pathway mediates the effects of polyphosphate, with one branch affecting proliferation, and the other branch affecting development. [10] Phosphorus (P) is responsible for algal growth and the structural changes in algal communities. Therefore, it is essential to know whether the different phosphorus availability to different algae can change the community structure. In this study, the interspecific competition was investigated at two bloom-forming cyanobacterium, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and Microcystis aeruginosa, when both were treated with five different phosphate compounds, including K<inf>2</inf>HPO<inf>4</inf>, \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b2-glycerol phosphate, (2-aminoethyl)-phosphinic acid, glyphosate, and P-free. The results of mono-culture experiments showed that the two species could utilize the dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) and K<inf>2</inf>HPO<inf>4</inf> (DIP) as the sole P resource. Moreover, the specific growth rates and the endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity in M. aeruginosa cells were much lower than those in C. raciborskii under DOP and DIP treatments. In the co-cultured experiments, however, a significant biomass increase in C. raciborskii was observed in all experimental P treatments, except for glyphosate, regardless of its initial cell density proportion. A 31.8\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c63.4% increase in cell number of C. raciborskii was found after incubated into K<inf>2</inf>HPO<inf>4</inf>, while the highest biomass of mixed samples, 17.72 \u00c3\u0083\u00e2\u0080\u0094 10<sup>6</sup> cell mL<sup>\u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00e2\u0080\u00991</sup>, was observed in the (2-aminoethyl)-phosphinic acid treatment (50C50M). Additionally, higher specific growth rate was also found in C. raciborskii when compared with M. aeruginosa under P-free; the increasing proportion of C. raciborskii were 29.1% (50C50M), 16.4% (75C25M), and 36.7% (25C75M), respectively. When the mixed samples were co-cultivated under glyphosate, C. raciborskii cells appeared to be depressed, whereas the cell density of M. aeruginosa increased rapidly. The findings indicated that an excellent P competition might give some advantages for C. raciborskii dominance in natural waters with DIP limitation or DOP abundance.",

In this study we evaluated the inheritance pattern of resistance to the chitin synthesis inhibitor lufenuron in Spodoptera frugiperda. RESULTS: The LC<inf>50</inf> values (95% CI) were 0.23 \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00bcg lufenuron mL<sup>-1</sup> water (ppm) (0.18-0.28) for the susceptible strain (SUS) and 210.6 \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00bcg mL<sup>-1</sup> (175.90-258.10) for the lufenuron-resistant strain (LUF-R), based on diet-overlay bioassay. The resistance ratio was \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u00b0\u00cb\u0086 915-fold. The LC<inf>50</inf> values for reciprocal crosses were 4.89 \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00bcg mL<sup>-1</sup> (3.79-5.97) for female LUF-R and male SUS and 5.74 \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00bcg mL<sup>-1</sup> (4.70-6.91) for female SUS and male LUF-R, indicating that the inheritance of S. frugiperda resistance to lufenuron is an autosomal, incompletely recessive trait. Backcrosses of the progeny of reciprocal crosses with the parental LUF-R showed a polygenic effect. The estimated minimum number of independent segregations was in the 11.02 range, indicating that resistance to lufenuron is associated with multiple genes in S. frugiperda. CONCLUSIONS: Based on genetic crosses, the inheritance pattern of lufenuron resistance in S. frugiperda was autosomal, incompletely recessive and polygenic.

One of the security issues is the augmented impact of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. In this paper, we create an application on the top of Beacon controller to mitigate the DoS attacks in the OpenFlow networks. The attacks include IP/MAC Spoofing and Bulky/Garbage Message. We launch the DoS attacks towards the network and analyze the performance of the application. All of these attacks, Beacon, and OpenFlow are implemented in the network simulation environment Mininet.

However, oviposition preferences for less damaged Bt crops can undermine this strategy, necessitating larger refuges or alternative approaches. Additionally, it is possible that integrating companion planting with pest-resistant varieties could further enhance the effectiveness of resistance management strategies in diverse agricultural systems [7].\n #Reference: [7]: Background: Transgenic crops expressing Bt toxins have substantial benefits for growers in terms of reduced synthetic insecticide inputs, area-wide pest management and yield. This valuable technology depends upon delaying the evolution of resistance. The 'high dose/refuge strategy', in which a refuge of non-Bt plants is planted in close proximity to the Bt crop, is the foundation of most existing resistance management. Most theoretical analyses of the high dose/refuge strategy assume random oviposition across refugia and Bt crops.Results: In this study we examined oviposition and survival of Spodoptera frugiperda across conventional and Bt maize and explored the impact of oviposition behavior on the evolution of resistance in simulation models. Over six growing seasons oviposition rates per plant were higher in Bt crops than in refugia. The Cry1F Bt maize variety retained largely undamaged leaves, and oviposition preference was correlated with the level of feeding damage in the refuge. In simulation models, damage-avoiding oviposition accelerated the evolution of resistance and either led to requirements for larger refugia or undermined resistance management altogether. Since larval densities affected oviposition preferences, pest population dynamics affected resistance evolution: larger refugia were weakly beneficial for resistance management if they increased pest population sizes and the concomitant degree of leaf damage.Conclusions: Damaged host plants have reduced attractiveness to many insect pests, and crops expressing Bt toxins are generally less damaged than conventional counterparts. Resistance management strategies should take account of this behavior, as it has the potential to undermine the effectiveness of existing practice, especially in the tropics where many pests are polyvoltinous. Efforts to bring down total pest population sizes and/or increase the attractiveness of damaged conventional plants will have substantial benefits for slowing the evolution of resistance. \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a9 2014 T\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9llez-Rodr\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00adguez et al.",

Food Safety and Quality: Ensuring food safety is a critical aspect of food technology, which can be fully achieved by merely implementing food safety management tools like risk analysis and monitoring systems, without considering the complexities of food supply chains and emerging threats [4].\n #Reference: [4]: Global food security and safety are threatened by a number of fast-occurring changes, even in the absence of natural disasters or terrorist attacks: overpopulation and urbanisation, environmental pollution, climate changes, intensive animal breeding, international trade and travel, emerging water- and food-borne diseases, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, increasing food costs, complexity of food supply chains, malnutrition and risky food behaviour. Food safety management tools, including food legislation, national and international standards, quality management systems, risk analysis, risk-based inspections and controls, monitoring and alert systems for food contaminants and food-borne diseases, quantitative microbial risk assessment, nutrition and toxicology studies, and elaborate food processing technologies have brought to consumers in developed countries a wide selection of safe foods. Predictive and early warning and communication systems are being developed to increase the ability to \"expect the unexpected\" and take prevention measures before food hazards become real risks. The production, processing, transportation, storage and/or distribution stages of modern food supply chains remain exposed to various types of biological or chemical contaminants, as evidenced by recent events or crises. The prion/BSE, dioxin, acrylamide, melamine, bisphenol A cases, and the numerous pathogen outbreaks illustrate this exposure. The melamine story and the international traffic of counterfeited foods and drinks show that profit-motivated fraud and adulteration are rising threats, opening potential paths for terrorist actions. Recent food preservation, processing or packaging technologies and trends, in spite or because of their benefits (mild treatment, extended product shelf-life, \"fresher\" quality, RTE pre-cooked convenience) also bring safety risks at the consumer level: incomplete microbial inactivation, possible non respect of adequate storage conditions and expiration dates, undercooking, and generation of stress-resistant micro-organisms. Innovative technologies, such as the use of nanoparticules in foods or food contact materials, and the development of active, intelligent or sustainable food packaging entail uncertainties and safety concerns. Natural disasters, droughts, floods, conflicts, and poverty often lead to emergency situations requiring large assistance operations with complex logistics and specific meals ready-to-eat or nutrient-supplemented foods. Containerised food processing units that could be deployed and quickly set to operate in -production-disrupted areas are being developed by the World Food Programme. Other strategies against food insecurity include insurance policies for crop failures and renting of agricultural lands abroad. Citizen perception of food safety risks and the EU consumers' \"right to informed choice\" explain why some technologies elicit rejection: ionising irradiation of foods, hormonal and antibiotic treatment of animals, the use of various \"-artificial\" food additives, genetically modified crops and ingredients, cloned animals. Perceived benefits responding to consumers' needs (healthier, more nutritive, higher quality, more convenient, lower cost), \"naturalness\", respect of the environment and trusted information are the major factors influencing consumers' acceptance of innovative food technologies and products. Novel foods and technologies are also subject to strict regulatory pre-market safety assessment and authorisation procedures. While necessary for protection against unexpected risks, some of these rules serve as barriers to innovation and trade, and fodder for strong political debates. \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a9 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

Medical images have been interpreted via computer tomography (CT), X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). The barriers of medical image segmentation need to be resolved due to low contrast amongst the lesion, the surrounding tissue and blurred edges of the lesion. Labeling manually for hundreds of slices of organs or lesions has been quite time-consuming due to anatomy of the human body and shape of lesions. Manual labeling has intended to high subjective and low reproducibility. Doctors have been beneficial from a automatically locating, segmenting and quantifying lesions. Deep learning has been used widely in medical image processing. Deep learning-based U-Net has played a key role in the lesions segmentation. The encoding and decoding ways has made U-Net structures simply and symmetrically. Features extraction of medical images has been realized via convolution and down-sampling operations. The image segmentation mask via the transposed convolution and concatenation has been interpreted. A small-sized dataset has achieved qualified medical image segmentation.

Four research areas have been proposed as below: 1) the basic structure and working principle of U-Net via convolution operation, down sampling, up sampling and concatenation. 2) U-Net network model have been demonstrated in three aspects in the context of the number of encoders, multiple U-Net cascades and other models combined with U-Net. U-Net based network have been divided into two, three and four encoders further in terms of the amount of encoders: Y-Net, \u00ce\u00a8-Net and multi-path dense U-Net. Multiple U-Nets cascade has been categorized into multiple U-Nets in series and multiple U-Nets in parallel based on the cascades mode of multiple U-Nets. In addition U-Net has improved the segmentation performance on the aspects of dual tree complex wavelet transform, local difference method, level set, random walk, graph cutting, CNNs(convolutional neural networks) and deep reinforcement learning. The upgrading of U-Net network structure have been divided into six subcategories including image augmentation, convolution operation, down-sampling operation, up-sampling operation, model optimization strategies and concatenation. Image enhancement has be divided into elastic deformation, geometric transformation, generative adversarial networks (GAN), Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGAN) and real-time image enhancement further. The convolution operation has been improved via padding mode and convolution redesign. The padding mode mentioned has adapted constant padding, zero padding, replication padding and reflection padding and improvements to dilated convolution, inception module and asymmetric convolution. The down-sampling has been improved via max-pooling, average-pooling, stride convolution, dilated convolution, inception module and spatial pyramid pooling. Several up-sampling improvements have illustrated simultaneously via sub-pixel convolution, transposed convolution, nearest neighbor interpolation, bilinear interpolation and trilinear interpolation. Model optimization strategies have been divided into two aspects in detail of activation function and normalization, the improvements of activation function includes rectified linear unit(ReLU), parametric ReLU(PReLU), random ReLU(RReLU), leaky ReLU(LReLU), hard exponential linear sigmoid squahing(HardELiSH) and exponential linear sigmoid squashing(ELiSH), and normalization method. The improvements have been to shown based on batch normalization, group normalization, instance normalization and layer normalization. The concatenation based improvement has been one of the future research area. The current concatenation improvements have been mainly realized via attention mechanism, new concatenation, feature reuse and de-convolution with activation function, annotation information fusion from Siamese network. The improved mechanisms in the U-Net network have been emphasized based on residual mechanism, dense mechanism, attention mechanism and the multi-mechanisms integration. The segmentation performance of the network can be enhanced. The further four research areas in U-Net have been illustrated as below: 1) the generalization of deep learning methods cannot be customized to fit the segmentation network for specific scenarios in the future. 2) Supervised deep learning models have required a lot of annotated images labeled for treatment. Unsupervised and semi-supervised deep learning models have been a vital research work further. 3) The low interpretability of U-Net network has lead the low acceptance in the mechanism of its operation.4) More accurate segmentation mask with fewer parameters has been obtained via good quality network structure. The precise manual segmentation has been so time-consuming and labor intensive. The simplified and quick semi-automatic segmentation has relied on the parameters and user-specified image preprocessing. The deep learning-based U-Net network has been segmented the lesions quickly, accurately and consistently. The structure, improvements and further research areas of U-Net network have been analyzed to the development of U-Net network.\n[2]: The glottis's morphology not only reflects vocal and respiratory information, but also plays an important role in the diagnosis of laryngeal diseases. The glottis segmentation is a primary step in computer-aided diagnostic system, however is challenging due to various shapes of glottis, low contrast with surrounding tissues, the existence of laryngeal diseases and so on. In this paper, a deep attention network based on U-Net with color normalization operation (CN-DA-Unet) is proposed to achieve an end-to-end segmentation of the glottal area for the first time. The original images are first processed by color normalization to reduce the adverse effects of low contrast and large differences in colors between different images. The normalized images are then sent to the proposed DA-Unet for feature extraction. In this network, residual structure is incorporated to extract rich features from deep neural networks. After extracting features, a feature pyramid attention (FPA) module is applied to enhance the semantic information of the glottal area. These features are up-sampled and added to the features from the corresponding encoding layer for several times to obtain the final segmented image. The proposed approach is tested on laryngeal images of an in\u00e2\u0080\u0093house dataset including images from healthy subjects and pathologic subjects.

[3] Computed Tomography (CT) has been widely used in the planning of radiation therapy, which is one of the most effective clinical lung cancer treatment options. Accurate segmentation of organs at risk (OARs) in thoracic CT images is a key step for radiotherapy planning to prevent healthy organs from getting over irradiation. However, known automatic image segmentation methods can hardly yield desired OAR delineation results, while manual delineation tends to take long time and tedious effort. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning network, called cascaded SE-ResUnet, for automatic segmentation of thoracic organs including left lung, right lung, heart, esophagus, trachea, and spinal cord. Specifically, we first use a coarse segmentation network to identify the regions of interest (ROIs), and then a fine segmentation network is applied to achieve refined segmentation results, organ by organ. Finally, different configured models are ensembled to obtain the final segmentation results. In the StructSeg 2019 Challenge, we showed the capability of our new framework and won the 1st place at the test phase. Our code is available open-source at https://github.com/zjuybh/StructSeg2019.",

However, the ease of copying digital files and sharing cryptographic keys makes an old problem from physical credential space more pressing: How do we prevent a credential from being used by someone other than its legitimate holder? Biometrics provide an answer-but they also introduce some complexity as well as trust and privacy concerns that need careful treatment. In this article, we explore three patterns of biometric use with verifiable credentials, identify appropriate use cases for each, and recommend best practices that make the patterns trustworthy, robust, and interoperable.\n[2]: A verifiable credential (VC) has been standardized and applied in vari-ous domains, including education. Due to its immutability, blockchain has been considered and used for credential issuance and verification. Most existing methods, however, are not compatible with the W3C VC stan-dard. In this paper, an on-chain VC issuance and verification method has been described. The method is based on the standard VC data model and applicable to any credential type. It decomposes a VC document into a VC template and the corresponding value array(s). This allows a VC to be issued on-chain in the Bitcoin BTC network, which has a limited data-embedding capacity. The proposed method reduces blockchain resource consumption due to the reusability of a VC template. In addition, it allows the use of a concise VC fingerprint format instead of a full VC for credential exchange. Two issuance modes, namely the full on-chain and partial on-chain, are proposed targeting different use cases. The proposed method has been applied for issuing and verifying two learning credential types. The method was evaluated on the Bitcoin Testnet to measure time and space complexities. With the reduced-size VC fingerprint, the proposed method can embed a VC on a traditional paper-based credential as a compact-sized QR code.

The aim of the study is to identify and systematize the methodological prerequisites for solving the problems of sustainable development of rural areas and their management. It was concluded that the sustainable development of rural areas contributed to the fulfillment of their economic functions, including the provision of food, agricultural raw stock, public goods, the production of goods and services, the preservation of the rural way of life and rural culture, enhanced reproduction of the population, development of public welfare and living standards, maintaining the ecological balance in the biosphere, as well as overcoming the interagency disunity between various levels of governance when deciding on the development of rural areas, which implied social partnership among the rural population, regions and the state. This made it possible to deepen the understanding of the nature of the emergence of agrarian crises and to justify the stability of the crisis trend as an initial prerequisite for the formation of a system for managing the development of both the entire economy and the agricultural sector, particularly in the context of analysis of the cyclical development of the economy and modern crisis theories.\n[6]: Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy, where two-thirds of the rural community depend on agriculture for their employment. Sustainable agriculture, with its ability to remain productive in the long term, may help ensure food security for communities in India.

We collected data concerning the domains of agricultural sustainability from 959 farmers\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 households.

        "input": "#Claim: Biological Control: Certain insects can be used to control specific weed species. For example, the water hyacinth weevil is effective against water hyacinth, and the weed flea beetle targets Alternanthera philoxeroides [9, 10, 20].\n #Reference: [9] Agriculture occupies an important place in improving the living standards of farmers in Pakistan. About 90% of farm earnings rely on the cultivation of sugar, fibre, cereals and legumes. Due to lack of essential resources and technical expertise, every year thousands of farmers fail to reach maximum yield potential. Over 70% of farmers own less than 5\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0ha in Pakistan; therefore, it is uneconomic to employ costly mechanical and chemical strategies for the control of pests in their crops. Among these pests, we eds are considered to be the major obstacle to crop production, and can ultimately result in crop failure. Traditionally, manipulation of cropping techniques was employed for the control of weeds; later on, development of synthetic chemical herbicides made it easier to control weeds in a very short time period. However, over time the increased use of herbicides has led to the development of herbicide resistant weeds. Furthermore, increasing environmental concerns, weed population shifts, and increased managerial costs have made it difficult for farmers to control these weed species within their limited economic resources. Nowadays, scientists and research organizations are being urged to provide innovative weed management solutions, with minimal ecological impacts. Studies have revealed the importance of cultural strategies for the management of weeds in different cropping systems. Research has proved that alternation of cultural practices, and selection of competitive crop cultivars, could be a possible strategy to minimize the competitiveness of weeds. Increased crop densities, narrower row spacing, intercropping and alternation in row directions are among the weed control strategies gaining rapid attention in many countries. Unfortunately, limited information is available about weed management using crop competition in Pakistan. This review article focusses on the importance of these agronomic practices in reducing the competitive potential of weeds, for their effective and appropriate management in major crops of Pakistan. It is intended to assist researchers in the design of economically viable and eco-friendly weed management strategies, which will aid in eliminating the burden of herbicides and mechanical cultivation from farmer's production costs. [10] In Spain, agriculture triggers soil degradation and erosion processes. New strategies have to be developed to reduce soil losses and recover or maintain soil functionality in order to achieve a sustainable agriculture. An experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of different agricultural management on soil properties and soil erosion. Five different treatments (ploughing, herbicide, control, straw mulch and chipped pruned branches) were established in \"El Teularet experimental station\" located in the Sierra de Enguera (Valencia, Spain). Soil sampling was conducted prior to treatment establishment, and again after 16 months, to determine soil organic matter content (OM), aggregate stability (AS), and microbial biomass carbon content (C<inf>mic</inf>). Fifty rainfall simulations tests (55 mm during one hour, 5-year return period) were applied to measure soil and water losses under each treatment. The highest values of OM, AS and C<inf>mic</inf> were observed in the straw-covered plot, where soil and water losses were negligible. On the contrary, the plot treated with herbicides had the highest soil losses and a slight reduction in C<inf>mic</inf>. Soil erosion control was effective after 16 months on the plots where vegetation was present while on the ploughed and herbicide-treated plots, the practices were not sustainable due to large water and soil losses. Except for the straw mulch plot, soil properties (OM, AS, C<inf>mic</inf>) were not enhanced by the new land managements, but soil erosion control was achieved on three of the five plots used (weeds, weeds plus straw and weeds plus chipped pruned branches). Erosion control strategies such as weeds, weeds plus straw mulch and weeds plus chipped branches mulch are highly efficient in reducing soil losses on traditional herbicide-treated and ploughed agricultural land. However, it takes longer to recover other soil properties such as OM, AS, and C<inf>mic</inf>. [20] Summary: There are many agronomic variables and management strategies other than herbicides that can be manipulated to discourage weed invasion. Combining several management strategies rather than relying on one will increase the likelihood of successful weed management. Encouraging optimal crop canopy health can guide decision-making and render agricultural land less susceptible to weed invasion. Then, when necessary, herbicides can be judiciously used to supplement cultural weed management techniques. In this review we have attempted to address two of the three major habitat characteristics that influence weed invasions - disturbances and, to a lesser extent, high resource ability. The remaining habitat characteristic, low species diversity, is difficult to address in modern agriculture, but can be an avenue of defence against invading species [89]. However, even intercropping, which is an effective ecological weed management technique [90], does not approach species diversity levels in natural ecosystems. A compromise to high species diversity in space is to maximize species diversity in time; this is best accomplished by ensuring that a given field is subjected to diverse rotational crops. Diverse crop rotations are probably the most effective management tool in maintaining crop health and limiting weed invasion opportunities. In the future, very clean (near weed-free) fields may not be considered acceptable [91]. We might do well to alter our view of what is desirable: from an ultra-clean crop with no weeds visible to a more species-rich field with sub-threshold communities of weeds. This approach could be termed ecological weed management [92]. Pest management in disciplines other than weed science may benefit from a few weeds [93, 94]. For example, root maggot (Delia spp) egg deposition and larval damage were reduced in plots where weeds were left in canola longer than the period recommended for optimal yields [95]. Combining and applying the techniques discussed above, reducing herbicide use, and tolerating low infestations of weeds may be the most sustainable form of weed management over the long-term. Ignoring ecological weed management techniques and maintaining current herbicide application practices will ensure a higher frequency of weed invasions of the resistant type [96, 97]. \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a9 2005 Birkh\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a4user Verlag.",

Variation in body size of sea urchin may reflect variation in more structurally complex reefs from isolated islands that provide shelter from predation.

Although D. mexicanum is considered a great force of erosion to the substratum in reef environments in the eastern tropical Pacific, no evidence of erosion was observed at Isla San Jorge, indicating a balanced dynamic between herbivores, macroalgae, and corals.",

Its population density is likely stable across different reef sites, despite indications of food availability and environmental conditions being influential [5].\n #Reference: [5]: The annual and lunar reproductive cycle of the widely distributed edible sea urchin Tripneustes gratilla (L) was examined through measurements of gonad index, histological examination of gametogenesis, and induction of spawning with KCl injections. The population density and morphological characteristics of urchins at Diani, Kanamai, and Vipingo reef lagoons were also studied as well as the effects of seawater temperature and light on reproduction. Gonad growth started early during the northeast monsoon and reached a peak in June at the beginning of the southeast monsoon followed by a sharp decrease in gonad size of 50% in July and August towards the end of the southeast monsoons. Histological examination of gonads, revealed many different stages of gametogenesis with gametes present throughout the year, indicating continuous reproduction. There was a significant relationship between gonad index and lunar day with spawning occurring between lunar day 7 and 21, but spawning was not in perfect synchrony in the population. The population density of urchins at each reef is variable from year to year and was highest on average at Vipingo. Urchins at Kanamai had the lowest gonad indices, the largest jaws and smallest individuals an indication of food limitation. The gonads (roe) of T. gratilla at all three sites, were perpetually 'runny' an attribute that is not suitable for urchin fisheries. Studies to develop techniques to improve roe quality are recommended. \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a9 Springer 2005.",

Purple urchins were less dense and more cryptic inside a local marine protected area (MPA) that contained high predator abundance than in nearby heavily fished areas, whereas red urchins rarely were found outside the MPA. Urchin proportional mortality was inversely density dependent during the day when sheephead were active, despite fish aggregations in plots of high urchin density, but was density independent during the night when lobsters were active. Urchin mortality was reduced under understory algal cover during the day, but not during the night. Examining whether urchin mortality from predation is density dependent and how habitat complexity influences this relationship is imperative because behavioral changes and increases in urchin populations can have vast ecological and economic consequences in kelp forest communities.",

This is particularly true in large incident and emergency management systems. The increasing complexity creates significant challenges to the design of user interfaces (UIs). One of the fundamental goals of UI design is to provide users with intuitive and effective interaction channels to/from the computer system so that tasks are completed more efficiently and user's cognitive work load or stress is minimized. To achieve this goal, UI and information system designers should understand human cognitive process and its implications, and incorporate this knowledge into task design and interface design. In this chapter we present the design of CAMI, a cognition-adaptive multimodal interface, for a large metropolitan traffic incident and emergency management system. The novelty of our design resides in combining complementary concepts and tools from cognitive system engineering and from cognitive load theory. Also presented in this chapter is our work on several key components of CAMI such as real-time cognitive load analysis and multimodal interfaces. \u00c2\u00a9 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.\n[5]: The diversity of users' cognitive skills remains the challenge of public information system interface design. In this paper, we focus on the universal interaction design method for public information systems like kiosks. We have developed a method with six steps based on the resources model. The method we proposed aims at reducing users' cognitive load and enabling designers to optimize interface information. To validate this method, two prototypes were designed based on the method and a usability test was conducted to compare users' cognitive load, performance and satisfaction between the designed prototypes and the current referencing system. Results show that, in contrast with the current reference system, prototypes we designed based on the proposed method can reduce user's cognitive load, and enhance user's performance and satisfaction. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",

While higher temperatures are often thought to enhance the degradation process, the findings indicate that temperature may also negatively impact phytotoxicity reduction, suggesting that maintaining an optimal temperature range could complicate the decomposition process rather than simply accelerating it [3].\n #Reference: [3]: Micro-aerobic digestion was firstly applied for further stabilization and phytotoxicity reduction of high-solid anaerobically digested sludge (ADS) in room temperature, mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. Organic matter degradation and microbial community succession were determined by fluorescent and X-ray photoelectron spectrometers, and Illumina MiSeq sequencing analysis during the process. Results showed that specific oxygen uptake rate, volatile solid and ammonia nitrogen contents of the ADS reduced by 36.1-86.4%, 8.4-16.2% and 70.2-85.4%, respectively after micro-aerobic digestion, and these changes had an increasing tendency with the temperature. They implied that micro-aerobic digestion promoted in-depth stabilization of the ADS, which temperature increase had a positive effect on. Protein-like and carbohydrate-like groups decreased, and humic acid-like and carboxyl materials enriched, while microbial community succession shifted from unassigned bacteria and Tepidimicrobium to Pseudomonas and Desulfuromonadales during the micro-aerobic process. Phytotoxicity tests revealed that micro-aerobic digestion reduced the inhibition of the ADS to germination and root growth of three plant seeds, but temperature had an adverse impact on the phytotoxicity reduction. Overall, the findings indicated that mesophilic micro-aerobic digestion was an alternative technique for the post-treatment of high-solid ADS.",

Of the distinct parts of a system (hardware and software), it is the interface that permits the user access to computer resources. The seven principles of \"Universal Design\" or \"Design for Everyone\" focus on a universal usable design, but at the same time acknowledge the influences of internal and external factors.

[6] A well-designed system is made up of well-executed principles. These principles are easy to understand, simple to express and has complex applications. An ideal central design system is to break it into modules that hide complex implementations behind clear interfaces. This refers to encapsulation which makes the interface easy for other programmers to use. Handling interfaces depend on what is being separated. Assembling larger-grained systems must be constructed without coupling and the component's interaction should be considered as vital. Design and programming intertwines act as a vital design documentation. Testing of the actual design requires an agile method which is a powerful design aid for it considers interfaces before implementation. Lastly, representing a design may be done through a graphical notation. [17] Basically, information system design is fundamental to the long-term sustainability of information systems. Information system architecture is a reference in developing and building new information systems if the current system is no longer able to support the activities of an organization or company. There are various information system development methods and there are various information systems architecture models. The choice of using methods and models must be carefully considered so that the information system created is right on target. A variety of techniques will be introduced to enrich knowledge in choosing development methods and architectural models that suit the needs of the organization.",

We describe the development of a microbial consortium that can convert marine organic fish waste solids to biomethane at over 90% efficiency. The halotolerant microbial consortium, which was developed by sequential transfer in seawater with fish waste, is optimized for low COD:N ratios typical of organic fish waste and does not require addition of amendments such as organic carbon or nutrients. Temperatures for maximum rates of conversion range from 26 to 35. \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. Five predominant phylotypes identified in the microbial consortium by denaturing HPLC were isolated. Two isolates included anaerobic fermentative bacteria identified as a strain of Dethiosulfovibrio and a strain closely related to Fusobacterium spp., which both hydrolyze and ferment proteins, peptides and amino acids. The other three isolates included an acetate-utilizing methanogenic archaeon identified as a strain of Methanosarcina and two hydrogen-utilizing methanogenic archaea identified as strains of Methanogenium and Methanoplanus. Bioconversion rates of sterile fish waste with the reconstituted microbial consortium containing all five isolates were equivalent to rates observed with the original enriched consortium after one sequential transfer. The results demonstrate unequivocally that halotolerant consortia of bacteria and archaea can be developed for bioconversion of saline organic solid waste with high efficiencies equivalent to those attained with non-saline waste systems. Understanding the microbial community composition is critical for management of solid organic waste from land-based marine aquaculture systems and to maintain or restore microbiota during start up and throughout the production process. Statement of relevance: Appropriate disposal of solid organic wastes from land-based brackish and marine recirculating aquaculture systems is critical for promoting widespread acceptance and implementation.

This can involve adjusting brightness, contrast, and color, or removing noise. Additionally, the integration of virtual reality technologies with image enhancement techniques could revolutionize the way we interact with digital images in various fields, although this potential has not yet been fully explored [1, 2, 3].\n #Reference: [1]: Digital image processing is the use of computer algorithms to perform image processing on digital images. As a subcategory or field of digital image processing, digital image processing has many advantages over analog image processing. Image Enhancement is the process of adjusting digital images so that the results are more suitable for display or further image analysis. It can be used in removing the noise, sharpen, or brighten an image, making it easier to identify key features. Digital Image enhancement is to improve the image quality so that the resultant image is better than the original image for a specific application or set of objectives. The proposed collaborative method of gray level transformation algorithms, with alpha rooting algorithm for contrast enhancement. Enhancement techniques such as alpha rooting operate on the transform domain where as grey level transformations operate on individual pixel. The proposed collaborative method can able to change the whole images and also able to generate unwanted artifacts in many cases and enhance all the parts of the images.\n[2]: The modern-day society is increasingly dependent on computer-aided tools and techniques. Digital imaging techniques have a tremendous impact on our day-to-day lives. Image processing is a vital component in the field of biological sciences and has the potential to drastically change the computer-human interface. Image processing refers to the conversion of an image into a digital form followed by enhancement of the image in order to extract useful information from it that are indiscernible by human ocular perceivers. Rapid advances in image processing, computerized reconstruction of an image and allied advancements in image analysis algorithms and the application of artificial intelligence has spurred a revolution in the field of medical and diagnostic imaging. Deep learning, a type of Artificial Neural Network (Machine Learning), is resurfacing as a powerful tool for its utilization in big healthcare data. The integration of deep learning techniques to image processing has the potential to add momentum to the dermatological imaging and promote early and accurate diagnosis of skin lesions. This review attempts to discuss the fundamentals of image processing, its importance, various clinical imaging modalities in use in the field of dermatology and application of deep learning algorithms in dermatological imaging, accentuating the inadequacies and future research prospects.\n[3]: With a view of accomplishing the needs for further analysis on image, Image pre-processing methods are applied on an image for its betterment. Image enhancement is a pivotal part in digital image techniques. The main objective behind image enhancement is to apply an algorithm to original image, so that the resultant image is well suited for a specific task. Digital image enhancement is apt in providing diverse methods for better visualization of image for purpose of object detection and recognition by the machine. Enhancement techniques help us to view the image more efficiently by integrating color and intensity in it. This paper provides detail analysis of different basic enhancement techniques like Min-Max Filter, Gaussian filter, Invert filter, Histogram equalization and Contrast stretching for enrichment of image using ERDAS software.

Ethical work by consumers, such as reducing food waste, is crucial for the success of circular economy initiatives [5, 12, 13].\n #Reference: [5] For a transition toward the circular economy (CE) at the firm level, circular innovations are an essential requirement. Many companies are still hesitant to introduce circular solutions, as their future success chances are difficult to predict. Circular solutions often imply a high uncertainty and complexity because they are designed over multiple life cycles and are strongly interconnected with diverse stakeholders. Therefore, an effective selection process tailored to circular innovation is of great advantage. This study examines circular project selection by investigating selection processes and evaluation criteria for circular innovation management. A qualitative research design was chosen, including 18 in-depth interviews with CE experts and representatives from CE pioneer companies. Findings on the selection process show that circular innovation projects are often embedded in a strategic CE framework decision. Whereas idea generation is usually approached bottom-up involving different stakeholders, project evaluation is rather performed top-down by top management or in cross-functional teams. Furthermore, the study discusses evaluation criteria and their CE implications in detail and structures them into a criteria framework that can be used in multi-criteria decision models. This paper makes a theoretical contribution by connecting innovation and CE literature and by providing new knowledge on the still scarcely explored topic of circular project selection. As practical contribution, the study guides managers on how to approach project selection in circular innovation management and thus supports their development toward a CE. [12] Although the demand for organic fertilizers in agriculture is growing, it remains incipient in some production sectors, such as medicinal plant production, which does not possess specific technology for its development. Solid residues are highly contaminant to water sources, soil, populations and biodiversity but can potentially be used to produce organic composts and vermicompost, such production not only enables nutrient recycling but also acts on soil conditioning, increasing soil organic matter and improving its physical, chemical and biological characteristics, as well as strengthening organic production with an emphasis on medicinal plant production. In this context, recommendations for and applications of organic fertilizers available in the market were reviewed; in addition, the imminent socioeconomic demand for organic compost and vermicompost production was contextualized based on residues from coffee and sugarcane production and cattle farming for application to the medicinal plant production chain. It is concluded that although these sectors produce a considerable amount of residues, they are not being reused in formulation of organic composts and vermicompost, and commercial organic fertilizers recommended for medicinal plant production were not found. Thus, the formulation of vermicomposting and composting from the reuse of agricultural residues, are potential social, economic technologies and tools to be valued and disseminated to traditional and family farmers. [13] Tin is a component of many items used in daily activities, including solder in consumer electronics, tin can containing food and beverages, polyvinyl chloride stabilizers in construction products, catalysts in industrial processes, etc. China is the largest producer and consumer of refined tin, and more than 60% of this refined tin is applied in the electronics sector as solder. China is the leader in global economic growth; simultaneously, China is also a major producer and consumer of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE). Thus, future tin supply and demand in China are forecasted, based on the gross domestic product per capita and the average consumption of refined tin in past five years. Current tin reserves and identified resources in China can meet the future two decades of mine production, but import of tin will also be critical for China's future tin consumption. However, there will be a lot of uncertainty for import of tin from other countries. At the same time, virgin mining of geological ores is a process of high energy consumption and destruction of the natural environment. Hence recycling tin from Sn-bearing secondary resources like tailings and waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) can not only address the shortage of tin mineral resources, but also save energy and protect the ecological environment.",

Firstly, there are many tools in deep learning field, but these tools are not convenient to use for non-expert users because the installation and usage of them are really complex. Secondly, the diversity of deep learning is limited because the flexibility of existing deep learning models is not enough.

On the other hand, we estimate the impact of output growth on emissions concerning energy usage variation, as a higher economic growth does not necessarily mean energy-intensive activities. Our empirical findings support these intuitions as they indicate that pollutant emissions respond nonlinearly to energy consumption and GDP growth. We find an inverted U-shaped pattern for the impact of energy on CO<inf>2</inf>, in the sense that environmental degradation is declining beyond a given income threshold, which is estimated endogenously within the PSTR model.

The objective is development of automated smart cities intelligence system (SMACiSYS) with sensor-web access (SENSDI) utilizing geomatics for sustainable societies. There has been a need to develop automated integrated system to categorize events and issue information that reaches users directly. At present, no web-enabled information system exists which can disseminate messages after events evaluation in real time. Research work formalizes a notion of an integrated, independent, generalized, and automated geo-event analysing system making use of geo-spatial data under popular usage platform. Integrating Sensor Web With Spatial Data Infrastructures (SENSDI) aims to extend SDIs with sensor web enablement, converging geospatial and built infrastructure, and implement test cases with sensor data and SDI. The other benefit, conversely, is the expansion of spatial data infrastructure to utilize sensor web, dynamically and in real time for smart applications that smarter cities demand nowadays. Hence, SENSDI augments existing smart cities platforms utilizing sensor web and spatial information achieved by coupling pairs of otherwise disjoint interfaces and APIs formulated by Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) keeping entire platform open access and open source. SENSDI is based on Geonode, QGIS and Java, that bind most of the functionalities of Internet, sensor web and nowadays Internet of Things superseding Internet of Sensors as well. In a nutshell, the project delivers a generalized real-time accessible and analysable platform for sensing the environment and mapping the captured information for optimal decision-making and societal benefit. [3] Ubiquitous computing is about to become part of our everyday lives by integrating hundreds of \"invisible\" to us computing devices in our environment, so that they can unobtrusively and constantly assist us. This will imply more and smaller \"invisible\" sensors, homogeneously distributed and at the same time densely packed in host materials, responding to various stimuli and immediately delivering information. In order to reach this aim, the embedded sensors should be integrated within the host material, heading towards sensorial materials. The first step is to omit all parts that are not needed for the sensorial task and to find new solutions for a gentle integration. This is what we call function scale integration. The paper discusses sensor embedding in the human hand as an example of integration in nature, new technological applications and main challenges associated with this approach. \u00c2\u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, as most of these systems do not support spatial data types and spatial operators for managing spatial sensor data, they are not suitable for the USN environment. Therefore, in this paper, we design and implement Spatial TinyDB which is a spatial sensor database system that extends TinyDB to support spatial data types and spatial operators for the efficient management of spatial sensor data. In particular, Spatial TinyDB provides memory management and filtering functions to reduce system overload caused by sensor data streams.

The emission tests were performed following the NEDC (New European Driving Cycle) and regulated and unregulated emissions were measured for two vehicles - one equipped with a DOC (diesel oxidation catalyst) and the other equipped with a DPF (diesel particulate filter). Emissions of THC (total hydrocarbon), CO, and PM (particulate matter) generally decreased with increasing biodiesel content in the fuel, while NO<inf>x</inf> emissions increased slightly in both vehicles. CO<inf>2</inf> emissions were virtually identical. The extent of PM reduction in the DPF-equipped vehicle was almost 40 times higher than in the DOC-equipped vehicle. PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) emissions decreased with increasing biodiesel content in the fuel, with average reduction rates of the six biodiesels for particle-phase PAHs compared to the base diesel fuel in the range of 18.2-27.2% and 48.9-79.7% for the DOC- and DPF-equipped vehicles, respectively. Nanoparticle emissions from the DOC- and DPF-equipped vehicles were predominantly in the size range of 25.5-191.1nm and <25.5nm, respectively.\n[4]: The effect of biodiesel (rapeseed oil methyl ester, RME) and low sulfur fuels on the fuel consumption and emission characteristics of a diesel engine was investigated. The engine tests were carried out based on the 13-mode ECE-49 procedure. Particulate Matter (PM) distribution was analyzed with the state-of-the-art technique of Scanning Mobility Particle Sizing (SMPS). Compared to the base line diesel fuel, biodiesel emitted 20 to 80 % less specific CO, HC, PM, and aromatic hydrocarbons. The electrical mobility diameter of the majority of PM emitted from biodiesel was found to be in the range of 10 to 100 nanometers. The low sulfur fuel emitted 50 % less specific PM compared to the conventional diesel fuel. The aldehydes emission of biodiesel is much lower compared to fossil fuels. The major deficit of the biodiesel fuel was its higher specific fuel consumption rate that was in the range of 12 % (by weight) higher than the other fuels. A relatively higher NO<inf>x</inf> emission at high loads was encountered for biodiesel fuel.\n[5]: This paper presents the regulated and unregulated exhaust emissions of a diesel passenger vehicle, operated with low sulphur automotive diesel and soy methyl ester blends. Emission and fuel consumption measurements were conducted under real driving conditions (Athens Driving Cycle, ADC) and compared with those of a modified New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) using a chassis dynamometer. A Euro II compliant diesel vehicle was used in this study, equipped with an indirect injection diesel engine, fuelled with diesel fuel and biodiesel blends at proportions of 5, 10, and 20% respectively. Unregulated emissions of 11 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 5 nitro-PAHs, 13 carbonyl compounds (CBCs) and the soluble organic fraction (SOF) of the particulate matter were measured. Qualitative hydrocarbon analysis was also performed on the SOF. Regulated emissions of NO<inf>x</inf>, CO, HC, CO<inf>2</inf>, and PM were also measured over the two test cycles. It was established that some of the emissions measured over the (hot-start) NEDC differed from the real-world cycle. Significant differences were also observed in the vehicle's fuel consumption between the two test cycles. The addition of biodiesel reduced the regulated emissions of CO, HC and PM, while an increase in NO<inf>x</inf> was observed over the ADC. Carbonyl emissions, PAHs and nitro-PAHs were reduced with the addition of biodiesel over both driving cycles. \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a9 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n[6]: Regulated emissions in the exhaust from a diesel engine with biodiesel fuel are studied, and the emission characteristics of particulate matter (PM), soluble organic fraction (SOF) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emissions in PM are highlighted. In the experiment, pure diesel fuel and B10 (10% biodiesel blend with diesel fuel) fuel are chosen. Compared to pure diesel, the emissions of PM, SOF and PAHs of the diesel engine decrease when the engine burns B10 fuel, and the NOx emission is slightly increases, while the HC and CO emissions also decline. Besides, the relative proportions of Alcohols, Ketones and Ethers in the SOF emission of the engine with B10 are reduced. The relative proportions of Esters, Acids and Aldehydes ascend. Among the detected 12 kinds of PAHs, emission concentrations of 10 kinds of PAHs of the engine with B10 descend. Especially Benzo(a)pyrene and some other carcinogenicity PAHs, the decrease of B10 is distinct compared to pure diesel. The result indicates that the chemical toxicity of exhaust PM decreases when the diesel engine uses biodiesel fuel. \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a92012 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.",

In this study, several wind turbine designs have been analyzed and optimized designs have been proposed for low wind speed areas around the world mainly for domestic energy consumption. The wind speed range of 4-12 mph is considered, which is selected based on the average wind speeds in the Atlanta, GA and surrounding areas. These areas have relatively low average wind speeds compared to various other parts of the United States. Traditionally wind energy utilization is limited to areas with higher wind speeds. In reality a lot of areas in the world have low average wind speeds and demand high energy consumption. In most cases, wind turbines are installed in remote offshore or away from habitat high wind locations, causing heavy investment in installation and maintenance, and loss of energy transfer over long distance. A few more advantages of small scale wind turbines include reduced visibility, less noise and reduced detrimental environmental effects such as killing of birds, when compared to traditional large turbines. With the latest development in wind turbine technology it is now possible to employ small scale wind turbines that have much smaller foot print and can generate enough energy for small businesses or residential applications. The low speed wind turbines are typically located near residential areas, and are much smaller in sizes compared to the large out of habitat wind turbines. In this study, several designs of vertical and horizontal axes wind turbines are modeled using SolidWorks e.g. no-airfoil theme, airfoil blade, Savonius rotor etc. Virtual aerodynamic analysis is performed using SolidWorks Flow simulation software, and then optimization of the designs is performed based on maximizing the starting rotational torque and ultimate power generation capacity. From flow simulations, forces on the wind turbine blades and structures are calculated, and used in subsequent stress analysis to confirm structural integrity. Critical insight into low wind speed turbines is obtained using various configurations, and optimized designs have been proposed. The study will help in the practical and effective utilization of wind energy for the areas around the globe having low average wind speeds.",

Changes in water chemistry, such as increased nutrient levels, can significantly impact chlorophyll a concentrations, as seen in studies of other environmental disturbances [4, 5].\n #Reference: [4]: The frequency of harmful algal blooms caused by eutrophication is increasing globally, posing serious threats to human health and economic development. Reservoir bays, affected by water environment and local watershed landscape, are more prone to eutrophication and algal blooms. The chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration is an important indicator for the degree of eutrophication and algal bloom. Exploring the complex relationships between water environment and landscape background, and Chl a concentration in the reservoir bays are crucial for ensuring high-quality drinking water from reservoirs. In this study, we monitored Chl a concentrations of 66 bays in Danjiangkou Reservoir and the related water quality parameters (e.g., water temperature, turbidity, nutrients) in waterbodies of these reservoir bays in the storage and discharge periods from 2015 to 2018. Partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to quantify the relationship between water environmental factors and watershed landscapes, and Chl a concentrations in reservoir bays. The results showed that mean Chl a concentration was higher in storage period than that in discharge period. Two optimal PLS-SEMs explained 66.8% and 53.6% of Chl a concentration variation in the storage and discharge periods, respectively. The net effect of water chemistry on Chl a concentration was more pronounced during the discharge period (total effect = 0.61, 37% of the total effect on Chl a), while the net effect of land-use composition on Chl a concentration was more significant during the storage period (total effect = 0.57, 30% of the total effect on Chl a). The landscape pattern had significant indirect effects on Chl a concentration, especially during the discharge period (indirect effect = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00e2\u0080\u00990.31, 19% of the total effect on Chl a). Our results provide valuable information for managers to make rational decisions, thereby contributing to the prevention of eutrophication and algal blooms in reservoir bays.\n[5]: The combination of low pH and high concentrations of metals associated with acid mine drainage would have severe toxicological effects on aquatic ecosystems. In order to evaluate the potential impact of acid mine drainage on the benthic algal communities in Gaolan River, which is one of the three main tributaries of Xiangxi River, we chose three sites in pyrite mining area as impaired group (I) , four uninfluenced sites were taken as control group (C) and five sites as recovery group (R). The results showed that benthic algal density, chlorophyll a concentration, ash free dry mass (AFDM) and autotrophic index (Al) were significantly affected by acid mine drainage from pyrite in the upstream of Gaolan River, while dry season affected seriously than flood season. Correlation analysis showed autotrophic index was positively correlated with metals and negatively correlated with pH, so Al could be a better indicator in the case where a pollutant such as acid mine drainages.",

Bakso has been a very good low-cost protein source for all. By understanding the complexity of the colloidal structure of Bakso that is constructed by the protein matrix and swelling starch granule interactions, it is also made clear in this review that Bakso has the potential for being more than just a low-cost protein source meal enjoyed by all. The colloidal complexities of the food system in Bakso allows it to entrap fortifications of bioactive compounds, bringing Bakso to the realm of functional foods. Various simple attempts have been made to improve the eating quality of Bakso by simple substitution of the starch with other plant-sourced starches that have functional properties. Effectiveness of these attempts had not scratched the surface of elevating Bakso into the functional food world, therefore it is an opened option to explore the potential of bringing encapsulation of functional components in this mini review processes into the mix.

        "input": "#Claim: Taxonomic Diversity Community Composition Shifts: Changes in land use can lead to shifts in community composition. For example, urban and agricultural sites tend to have higher abundances of pollution-tolerant species like oligochaetes and chironomid midges, while sensitive species decline. Additionally, it is plausible that the introduction of new invasive species in urban areas could further exacerbate these shifts in community composition, although this specific impact has not been directly studied in the context of the referenced research [2, 3].\n #Reference: [2]: Running waters are among the most threatened ecosystems globally, having altered hydrological regimes, homogenized habitat, and impaired water quality. These multiple stressors impact aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem function across space and time, although a clear mechanistic understanding is still lacking. Here, we examined the trophic response of macroinvertebrates among streams in a Swiss lowland catchment encompassing a gradient of land uses. Clear compositional changes were observed as anthropogenic impacts increased from least-impacted to agricultural and urbanized sites. Taxonomic diversity was lowest at sites with morphological and water quality impairment (agricultural sites), whereas taxonomic identity (susceptible vs. generalist species) mainly changed due to water quality degradation (agricultural and urban sites) based on the SPEAR (pesticides) index. Using stable isotopes (\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b4<sup>13</sup>C, \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b4<sup>15</sup>N), a simplification in macroinvertebrate trophic structure was evident along the land use gradient. At a site receiving wastewater treatment effluent, stable isotopes also revealed trophic shifts in primary consumers that corresponded to changes in available food resources. Results further showed that some taxa losses, e.g., the mayfly Ecdyonurus, to land- use effects may be due to low trophic plasticity. The combination of analyses, including stable isotopes, provided an improved mechanistic understanding of community and population responses to land-use changes along river networks.\n[3]: Knowledge of relationships between land cover (i.e., land use) and abiotic and biotic features of headwater streams enhances our ability to predict and effectively assess conditions in a variety of aquatic ecosystems. We evaluated land use effects on stream condition in an Iowa watershed dominated by intensive row crop agriculture and low- intensity urban development by quantifying relationships among land cover, stream invertebrate assemblages and other stream biophysical characteristics (i.e., invertebrate habitat) at 29 sites. On average, 81% of subbasin land cover was agricultural and 6% of land cover was urban across study sites. High nitrate concentrations (range = 5.6 29.0 Amg/L) and high relative abundance of oligochaetes and chironomid midges reflected degraded conditions at all sites. However, agriculture and urban land use appeared to have different effects on stream features. Nitrate concentrations were positively related to agricultural land cover, and turbidity and nitrate concentrations were negatively related to urban land cover (P \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u00b0\u00c2\u00a4\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u00b0\u00c2\u00a4 0.05). Invertebrate densities and taxonomic diversity (i.e., total taxa richness, % EPT) were also positively related to agricultural land cover and negatively related to urban land cover. Regardless of land use, highest invertebrate abundance and taxonomic diversity occurred at sites with abundant coarse particulate organic matter, plants and coarse inorganic substrate. Relationships between land cover and invertebrate variables were strong at both local and subbasin measurement scales. Based on invertebrate assemblages, which integrate multiple instream features, we conclude that urban land use had greater adverse effect on stream condition than agriculture in our study watershed. Although impacts of urbanization on stream invertebrates frequently exceed effects of agriculture, this has not previously been demonstrated in Iowa or other Midwestern landscapes so heavily dominated by agriculture. \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a9 2011 American Midland Naturalist.",

Localized changes in land use can affect species richness and composition differently than regional changes [4, 5].\n #Reference: [4]: Measures of functional diversity are expected to predict community responses to land use and environmental change because, in contrast to taxonomic diversity, it is based on species traits rather than their identity. Here, we investigated the impact of landscape homogenisation on plants, butterflies and birds in terms of the proportion of arable field cover in southern Finland at local (0.25 km<sup>2</sup>) and regional (> 10 000 km<sup>2</sup>) scales using four functional diversity indices: functional richness, functional evenness, functional divergence and functional dispersion. No uniform response in functional diversity across taxa or scales was found. However, in all cases where we found a relationship between increasing arable field cover and any index of functional diversity, this relationship was negative. Butterfly functional richness decreased with increasing arable field cover, as did butterfly and bird functional evenness. For butterfly functional evenness, this was only evident in the most homogeneous regions. Butterfly and bird functional dispersion decreased in homogeneous regions regardless of the proportion of arable field cover locally. No effect of landscape heterogeneity on plant functional diversity was found at any spatial scale, but plant species richness decreased locally with increasing arable field cover. Overall, species richness responded more consistently to landscape homogenisation than did the functional diversity indices, with both positive and negative effects across species groups. Functional diversity indices are in theory valuable instruments for assessing effects of land use scenarios on ecosystem functioning. However, the applicability of empirical data requires deeper understanding of which traits reliably capture species\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 vulnerability to environmental factors and of the ecological interpretation of the functional diversity indices. Our study provides novel insights into how the functional diversity of communities changes in response to agriculturally derived landscape homogenisation; however, the low explanatory power of the functional diversity indices hampers the ability to reliably anticipate impacts on ecosystem functioning.\n[5]: Aim: Changes in land use and cover (hereafter land use) affect freshwater ecosystems at different spatial scales.

Methods: We used multiple regression models for distance matrices to identify the relative importance of environmental and landscape characteristics to explain community dissimilarity of stream macroinvertebrates with different mobility traits. As predictors, we calculated four distance metrics: environmental distance describing the dissimilarity in local conditions, the network distance accounting for distances across the drainage system and two distances measuring landscape resistance to dispersal (topographic and land use). We classified macroinvertebrates in dispersal groups according to their dispersal abilities (flying and drifting) and life story traits (voltinism, adult life span and body size). We tested the effects of these distances on all taxa and on the different dispersal groups, to explore whether biological traits would result in different metacommunity patterns. Results: Our hierarchical clustering analysis identified five macroinvertebrate dispersal groups. The dispersal group 1 was mainly composed by aquatic obligate taxa, dispersal group 2 by taxa with low drift propensity, dispersal group 3 represented taxa with high directional flight capacity, dispersal group 4 included taxa with medium drift propensity and dispersal group 5 represented taxa with high drift propensity. We found that environmental distance and land use distance were the most important predictors explaining community dissimilarity for most of the dispersal groups. Main conclusion: The metacommunity patterns found in this study suggest that environmental filtering was the most important community assembly mechanism at a local scale, whereas land use could constrain dispersal at the regional scale. Understanding these processes is crucial to meet conservation and restoration goals, especially in biodiversity hotspots. Our results reinforce the importance of considering entire catchments for preserving stream health and aquatic biodiversity and indicate the need for a much more integrative research between terrestrial and aquatic ecology.",

Implementing such a framework would enhance data protection standards for QRIS.\n #Reference: [4]: Purpose: The purpose of this paper is two-fold: to explore the legal issue of the importance of personal data protection in the digital economy sector and to propose a legal framework for personal data protection as a consumer protection strategy and accelerate the digital economy. Design/methodology/approach: This study is legal research. The research approach used was the comparative approach and statute approach. The legal materials used are all regulations regarding personal data protection that apply in Indonesia, Hong Kong and Malaysia. The technique of collecting legal materials is done by using library research techniques. Findings: The value of Indonesia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s digital economy is the biggest in the Southeast Asia region, but data breach is still a big challenge to face. The Indonesian Consumers Foundation (Yayasan Lembaga Konsumen Indonesia) recorded 54 cases of a data breach in e-commerce, 27 cases in peer-to-peer lending and 5 cases in electronic money. Based on the results of a comparative study with Hong Kong and Malaysia, Indonesia has yet no specific Act that comprehensively regulates personal data protection. Indonesia also does not have a personal data protection commission. Criminal sanctions and civil claims related to data breaches have not yet been regulated. Research limitations/implications: This study examines the data breach problem in the Indonesian digital economy sector. However, the legal construction of personal data protection regulations is built on the results of a comparative study with Hong Kong and Malaysia. Practical implications: The results of this study can be useful for constructing the ideal regulation regarding the protection of personal data in the digital economy sector. Social implications: The results of the recommendations in this study are expected to develop and strengthen the protection of personal data in the Indonesian digital economy sector. Besides aiming to prevent the misuse of personal data, the regulation aims to protect consumers and accelerate the growth of the digital economy. Originality/value: Indonesia needs to create a personal data protection act. The act should at least cover such issues: personal data protection principles; types of personal data; management of personal data; mechanism of personal data protection and security; commission of personal data protection; transfers of personal data; resolution mechanism of personal data dispute and criminal sanctions and civil claims.",

The patient suffered an episode of severe hypothermia (a life-threatening complication), requiring admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and later to Internal Medicine, before being reviewed by the hospital Psychiatric Department. After ruling out other etiological and pathophysiological hypothermia options, and after a thorough and complete medical examination, it was reasonably concluded that the most likely source of hypothermia was attributable to a recent increase in the dose of haloperidol the patient was taking. Studies suggest the possibility of occurrence of haloperidol-induced hypothermia, not only in laboratory animals, but also in humans. However, haloperidol is not the only antipsychotic drug which has been attributed to this adverse effect, as hypothermic episodes with other typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs have also been reported.\n[2]: Objective: To review current knowledge surrounding the effects, treatment, and prognosis of hypothermia in people, dogs, and cats, as well as the application of therapeutic hypothermia in clinical medicine. Etiology: Hypothermia may be a primary or secondary condition, and may be due to environmental exposure, illness, medications, anesthesia, or trauma. Hypothermia has been applied therapeutically in human medicine for a variety of conditions, including postcardiac arrest. In veterinary medicine, the technique has been applied in cardiac surgeries requiring bypass and in a patient with intractable seizures. Diagnosis: Hypothermia can be diagnosed based on presenting temperature or clinical signs, and appropriate diagnosis may require nontraditional thermometers. Therapy: Rewarming is the primary treatment for accidental hypothermia, with intensity ranging from passive surface rewarming to extracorporeal rewarming. The goal is to return the core temperature to a level that restores normal physiologic function of all body processes. Other supportive therapies such as intravenous fluids are typically indicated, and if cardiopulmonary arrest is present, prolonged resuscitation may be required. In cases of secondary hypothermia, reversal of the underlying cause is important. Prognosis: There are few prognostic indicators in human and veterinary patients with hypothermia. Even the most severely affected individuals, including those presenting in cardiopulmonary arrest, have potential for complete recovery with appropriate therapy. Therapeutic hypothermia has been shown to improve outcome in people following cardiac arrest. Further studies are needed to examine this application in veterinary medicine, as well as appropriate therapy and prognosis for cases of spontaneous hypothermia.",

In addition to being treated with hypothermia, critically ill patients are treated with an extensive pharmacotherapeutic regimen. The effects of hypothermia on drug disposition increase the probability for unanticipated toxicity, which could limit its putative benefit. This review examines the effects of therapeutic hypothermia on the disposition, metabolism, and response of drugs commonly used in the intensive care unit, with a focus on the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: A MEDLINE/PubMed search from 1965 to June 2006 was conducted using the search terms hypothermia, drug metabolism, P450, critical care, cardiac arrest, traumatic brain injury, and pharmacokinetics. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Twenty-one studies were included in this review. The effects of therapeutic hypothermia on drug disposition include both the effects during cooling and the effects after rewarming on drug metabolism and response. The studies cited in this review demonstrate that the addition of mild to moderate hypothermia decreases the systemic clearance of cytochrome P450 metabolized drugs between \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00c2\u00bc7% and 22% per degree Celsius below 37\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C during cooling. The addition of hypothermia decreases the potency and efficacy of certain drugs. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides evidence that the therapeutic index of drugs is narrowed during hypothermia. The magnitude of these alterations indicates that intensivists must be aware of these alterations in order to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of this modality. In addition to increased clinical attention, future research efforts are essential to delineate precise dosing guidelines and mechanisms of the effect of hypothermia on drug disposition and response. \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a9 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.\n[4]: Introduction: Therapeutic hypothermia is being employed clinically due to its neuro-protective benefits. Both critical illness and therapeutic hypothermia significantly affect drug disposition, potentially contributing to drug-therapy and drug-disease interactions. Currently, there is limited information on the known alterations in drug concentration and response during mild hypothermia treatment, and there is a limited understanding of the specific mechanisms that underlie alterations in drug concentrations and the potential clinical importance of these changes. Areas covered: A systemic review of the effect of therapeutic hypothermia on drug metabolism, disposition and response is provided. Specifically, the clinical and preclinical evidence of the effects of therapeutic hypothermia on blood flow, specific hepatic metabolism pathways, transporter function, renal excretion, pharmacodynamics and the effects during rewarming are reviewed. Expert opinion: Available evidence demonstrates that mild hypothermia decreases the clearance of a variety of drugs with apparently little change in drug-protein binding. Recent evidence suggests that the magnitude of the change is elimination route specific. Further research is needed to determine the impact of these alterations on both drug concentration and response in order to optimize the therapeutic hypothermia in this vulnerable patient population. \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a9 Informa UK, Ltd.\n[5]: Background: Therapeutic hypothermia may alter both the pharmacokinetic (PK) and dynamics (PD) of the commonly used drugs in critical care.

Furthermore, it is currently under discussion that the use of psychotropic drugs in residential nursing homes may significantly contribute to freedom-restraining measures (FRM). In this context an interdisciplinary study was conducted to address questions related to this subject. Methods: The study included all residents of old age and nursing homes who died between 2013 and 2015 and were subsequently the subject of an autopsy at the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Munich. None of these cases harbored the suspicion of a\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0drug overdose. Records from the state prosecutor\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s office for each case as well as the macromorphological findings obtained during the autopsies were considered for data analysis. Urine samples were collected during the postmortem examinations and qualitatively analyzed for the presence of a\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0large number of drugs and drugs of abuse by means of liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The statistics software SPSS (IBM, version\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a023) was applied for a descriptive analysis of the data obtained. Results: Altogether 98 deceased residents of old age and nursing homes were included in the present study. Data obtained from the screening results of 95 of these cases showed that antipsychotic drugs (47.4%), antidepressants (30.5%), opioid analgesics (28.4%) and hypnotics/sedatives (20.0%) were among the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093top ten\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d most frequently detected drug classes. The results showed that several deceased from the investigated group simultaneously received a\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0combination of centrally active drugs. So-called PRISCUS substances could be detected in 25% of cases. Discussion: The results obtained during this study provide initial data on the spectrum of drugs that could be detected in deceased residents of old age and nursing homes. The number of substances detected is comparable to the prescription data obtained from health insurances. This retrospective study showed that older individuals simultaneously received a\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0high number of centrally active prescription drugs. This poses an increased risk for both drug interactions and side effects, particularly for this vulnerable patient group. The combinations of drugs detected in the deceased persons in some cases did not appear to correspond to the guidelines of specialist societies. There were indications for the simultaneous prescription of several opioid analgesics or hypnotic drugs. The prescription rate for PRISCUS drugs in the study collective was twice as high as the general German population of the same age living in their own home. Future studies with toxicological results obtained from blood and hair samples from the investigated group as well as the analysis of the available drug regimens are envisaged and will be published at a\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0later stage.",

Celiac disease, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, can be defined as a persistent intolerance of wheat gliadins and other cereal prolamines in the small intestinal mucosa of genetically susceptible individuals. The clinical picture of the disease can often be misleading because it varies greatly from patient to patient, resulting in delayed diagnosis.To analyze the clinical case of a child with celiac disease and acquired ichthyosis. Results. The disease, until a final diagnosis was established, had a severe course due to gastrointestinal and dermatological disorders. From the age of 1.5 years, the child had frequent diarrhea, bloating, which is why she was repeatedly hospitalized in the hospital at the place of residence. However, there was no effect from the ongoing therapeutic measures, and other symptoms such as vomiting, peripheral edema, deficiency of height and weight, and severe peeling of the skin joined in. The diagnosis was finally confirmed at the age of 2.5 years after the test for antibodies to tissue transglutaminase IgA (fifty-fold excess relative to the norm). A genetic study revealed alleles of genes responsible for predisposition to celiac disease. The results of a biopsy of the mucous membrane of the duodenum had signs of atrophy, lymphoid infiltration, corresponding to a lesion of the small intestine according to the classification Marsh III. Microscopic examination of the skin \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c hyperkeratosis with a decrease in the granular layer. On the basis of the obtained data, the diagnosis was made: Celiac disease, active phase, severe course, complicated by proteinenergy insufficiency severe degree, exudative enteropathy syndrome, 2 degree anemia, concomitant diagnosis: acquired ichthyosis. The girl was prescribed a gluten-free diet, and symptomatic drug therapy was carried out. In dynamics, the condition has improved. After 6 months, at the second visit, gastrointestinal and skin symptoms were absent, physical development was age-appropriate. Conclusions. The classic form of celiac disease usually manifests itself with several major symptoms, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and nutritional deficiencies. In this article we wanted to talk about a rare combination of celiac disease with ichthyosis, therefore, practitioners should be wary of a combination of skin and gastrointestinal symptoms.\n[11]: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease characterized by the malabsorption of nutrients because the villi of the small intestines are unable to process these nutrients. It is brought on by gluten food products. A pattern of enamel defects and oral aphthae are common findings in celiac disease, thus making the dentist an integral part of the diagnostic team.",

Most studies in this field have used generic questionnaires to measure HRQOL in celiac patients. It was therefore decided to conduct a study to translate into Spanish and validate a specific questionnaire for celiac disease, the Celiac Disease Quality Of Life Survey (CD-QOL). Objectives: to translate and validate in Spanish the specific celiac disease questionnaire CD-QOL. Methods: a multicenter, prospective, observational study was designed consisting of two phases: In the first phase, the questionnaire was translated and adapted into Spanish using the translation/back translation procedure and an understandability study. In the second phase, internal consistency of the translated questionnaire was analyzed. For this, results of the CD-QOL were compared to those of EuroQol and the Daily Fatigue Impact Scale (D-FIS). Understandability of the translated and adapted questionnaire was tested in six patients, and the validation study was done in 298 celiac patients (201 treated with a gluten-free diet and 97 at diagnosis). Results: in both celiac groups, Cronbach's alpha coefficient was high (0.90), feasibility was excellent (99.2 % of patients completed all questions), and there were no ceiling and floor effects. Spearman correlation to EuroQol and D-FIS was statistically significant (p < 0.05). CD-QOL score was different depending on whether state of health was good, fair, or poor based on the EuroQol score. Conclusion: the Spanish version of the CD-QOL is a valid tool for measuring HRQOL in celiac patients.",

Serum plasma renin-angiotensin activity, blood biochemical assays and urinary measurements were determined at the baseline and at the end of the 6 months. At the end of the study, the mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) of the ISH LSSalt group had significantly decreased by 10.18 mm Hg (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.13 to 17.2, P = .006) compared with that of the ISH NSalt group, while the mean SBP only decreased by 5.10 mm Hg (95% CI: -2.02 to 12.2, P = .158) in the NISH LSSalt group compared with that of the NISH NSalt group. The mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) had no significant differences in the ISH and NISH groups. No obvious renin angiotensin system activation was found after LSSalt intervention. Regarding the urinary excretion of electrolytes and blood biochemical assays, the LSSalt treatment had the same effects on the ISH group as on the NISH group. The present study showed that the SBP of ISH patients was significantly decreased with the LSSalt intervention, while neither the SBP of the NISH patients nor the DBP of either group were similarly decreased, which indicated that ISH patients were more sensitive to salt restriction.",

Electronic voting has become a significant research topic in the new century. Many countries use electronic voting devices, but there are still many flaws due to attacks present in the network system or the devices themselves. The aim of a secure voting system over Internet is to provide security attributes to the voting process like authentication and identification of voter, ballot encryption and signing, encrypted ballot transmission over Internet, privacy of the voter, anonymous ballot decryption, and counting of ballots, all in a secure way. A central server model for Internet voting is presented in this paper. With the concept of Public Key Cryptography (PKC), this model satisfies identification and authentication of the voter, confidentiality of the vote, integrity and anonymity of the ballot/vote. The objective of this paper is to present these privacy and security issues for the voter and the vote itself. \u00c2\u00a9 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.\n[4]: In recent years, electronic voting has become a very popular and topical topic. Electronic voting technology can speed up ballot counting and provide accessibility for voters with disabilities. Electronic voting can also facilitate electoral fraud, especially given the risks associated with remote voting. Building a secure electronic voting system that offers the fairness and privacy of current voting schemes, while providing the transparency and flexibility offered by electronic systems has been a challenge for a long time.

In order to solve this issue, an electronic voting system BFV-blockchainvoting that supported BFV homomorphic encryption was proposed, and this system applied the blockchain technology to the electronic voting system to replace the trusted third party. Firstly, an open and transparent bulletin board was used to record the vote information, and an intelligent contract was used to realize the functions of verification and self counting. Secondly, in order to further improve the security and reliability of the voting process, the voter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s registration information was signed by SM2 signature algorithm, the ballot was managed by both parties that can supervise each other, and the counting data was encrypted by the BFV full homomorphic encryption algorithm. Finally, the evaluation of performance shows that it only costs 1.69 ms to complete one ballot in the proposed electronic voting system. This electronic voting scheme based on the BFV full homomorphic encryption and blockchain has better security attributes such as manipulation-resistance, anonymity, verifiability, double-voting resistance, coercion-resistance and resistance to quantum attacks. The scheme is suitable for a variety of voting scenarios and can meet the efficiency requirements in large voting scenarios.\n[11]: Current electronic voting protocol require a centralized system to control the whole procedure from ballot inputs to result outputs and election monitoring. Meanwhile, blockchain technology provide a decentralized system which open across the whole network of untrusted participants. Applying blockchain technology into electronic voting protocol through a proper architecture can instil characteristic such as data confidentiality, data integrity and data authenticity. In this paper, we going to discuss a proposed method on how to leverage the advantages from blockchain into electronic voting protocol. This blockchain-based electronic voting protocol promise to provide a secure electronic election process given the proposed system works. We implement a protocol using blockchain to turn election protocol into an automated control system without relying any single point of entity. Lastly, we discuss the characteristics of our proposed blockchain-based electronic voting protocol in this paper. However, there are also emerging challenges and limitations awaiting to overcome.

In Lean, the principles emphasise value, where every activity that does not add value is seen as waste. Despite the strong focus on value, and that the primary critical success factor for software intensive product development lies in the value domain, no empirical study has investigated specifically what value is. This paper presents an empirical study that investigates how value is interpreted and prioritised, and how value is assured and measured. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with 23 participants from 14 agile software development organisations. The contribution of this study is fourfold. First, it examines how value is perceived amongst agile software development organisations. Second, it compares the perceptions and priorities of the perceived values by domains and roles. Third, it includes an examination of what practices are used to achieve value in industry, and what hinders the achievement of value. Fourth, it characterises what measurements are used to assure, and evaluate value-creation activities.\n[5]: Agile software development is successfully governed by producing working software that provide stakeholders with greater project visibility and involvement. The strategy is an extension of Scrum's requirements management strategy to take into account all types of work items preformed by software development teams. Agile teams develop working software, fulfilling the highest-priority work items, providing the greatest return on investment (ROl). The Stakeholders are put in control of the schedule as a side effect of producing working software each iteration. Agile processes based on the Unified Process such as OpenUp and Rational Unified Process (RUP) include explicit control points. The initial agile software modeling drives stakeholders to a general agreement as to the scope and vision of the effort to reduce major business risks.\n[6]: BACKGROUND: Agile software development methods have a number of reported benefits on productivity, project visibility, software quality and other areas. There are also negative effects reported. However, the base of empirical evidence to the claimed effects needs more empirical studies. AIM: The purpose of the research was to contribute with empirical evidence on the impact of using agile principles and practices in large-scale, industrial software development. Research was focused on impacts within seven areas: Internal software documentation, Knowledge sharing, Project visibility, Pressure and stress, Coordination effectiveness, and Productivity. METHOD: Research was carried out as a multiple-case study on two contemporary, large-scale software development projects with different levels of agile adoption at Ericsson. Empirical data was collected through a survey of project members. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Intentional implementation of agile principles and practices were found to: correlate with a more balanced use of internal software documentation, contribute to knowledge sharing, correlate with increased project visibility and coordination effectiveness, reduce the need for other types of coordination mechanisms, and possibly increase productivity. No correlation with increase in pressure and stress were found. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

        "input": "#Claim: Successful adoption of agile methods is often seen as straightforward, but it requires teams to develop the ability to quickly assimilate new knowledge and adapt to new practices, which can be challenging for most teams [1, 10].\n #Reference: [1]: Agile development methods have emerged to overcome some of the process and product-related problems associated with traditional models. They are believed to be lightweight, people focused, adaptive and allow better information systems development (ISD) performance. Nevertheless, they require a significant capacity of absorbing new set of skills, knowledge and mindset changing. When using agile methods IS developers are faced with a challenge to quickly assimilate the mindset of these new methods and develop the ability to recognize information and apply it in context. This paper reports on two ex-post ISD project implementation. We integrate a central construct in the dynamic capability theory - absorptive capacity to explain agile method adoption and usage. The findings show that absorptive capacity, indeed, plays an important role in adopting and using agile method-Extreme Programming model. The implications of these findings for both researchers and practitioners are discussed. \u00c2\u00a9 2011 IEEE.\n[10]: Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the relationship between agile production (flexible production technology) and absorptive capacity. Design/methodology/approach: We use a database of 1,864 Spanish industrial firms from the Survey of Business Strategies (the largest Spanish database of its kind). Our theoretical approach is based on the resource-based view and the dynamic capabilities perspective. The methodology includes descriptive statistics analysis and lineal regression with moderator effect. Findings: High-agile firms with greater absorptive capacity are more innovative and better performers than low-agile firms. Absorptive capacity moderates the relationship between flexible production technology and innovation performance. Research limitations/implications: This is a cross-sectional study, which may limit the establishment of causal relationships. We give evidence to the importance of studying absorptive capacity in the agile production implementation process. Practical implications: There are several managerial implications. First, agile production systems should be integrated into the firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s innovation system because the continuous improvement of agile production has to be reinforced by the outputs of external knowledge and in-house innovation activities. Second firms that use external sources of knowledge to improve production processes could leverage that benefit better, not only in Operations but also in innovation performance. The adoption of flexible production technology cannot be kept apart from the firm\u00c2\u00b4s organizational learning processes based on external knowledge. Our results also support the contribution of clusters of collaborative firms to improve their production processes throughout absorptive capacity and thus the implementation of agile production systems. Originality/value: This is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, has involved the role of absorptive capacity, as an internal capability/competence, to influence the relationship between agility/flexible technology and innovation performance.",

This paper presents an event-based approach to the detection of corner points, which benefits from the high temporal resolution, compressed visual information and low latency provided by an asynchronous neuromorphic event-based camera. The proposed method adapts the commonly used Harris corner detector to the event-based data, in which frames are replaced by a stream of asynchronous events produced in response to local light changes at \u00ce\u00bcs temporal resolution. Responding only to changes in its field of view, an event-based camera naturally enhances edges in the scene, simplifying the detection of corner features. We characterised and tested the method on both a controlled pattern and a real scenario, using the dynamic vision sensor (DVS) on the neuromorphic iCub robot. The method detects corners with a typical error distribution within 2 pixels. The error is constant for different motion velocities and directions, indicating a consistent detection across the scene and over time. We achieve a detection rate proportional to speed, higher than frame-based technique for a significant amount of motion in the scene, while also reducing the computational cost.\n[4]: Recently, the emerging bio-inspired event cameras have demonstrated potentials for a wide range of robotic applications in dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose a novel fast and asynchronous event-based corner detection method which is called FA-Harris. FA-Harris consists of several components, including an event filter, a Global Surface of Active Events (G-SAE) maintaining unit, a corner candidate selecting unit, and a corner candidate refining unit. The proposed G-SAE maintenance algorithm and corner candidate selection algorithm greatly enhance the real-time performance for corner detection, while the corner candidate refinement algorithm maintains the accuracy of performance by using an improved event-based Harris detector. Additionally, FA-Harris does not require artificially synthesized event-frames and can operate on asynchronous events directly. We implement the proposed method in C++ and evaluate it on public Event Camera Datasets. The results show that our method achieves approximately 8\u00c3\u0097 speed-up when compared with previously reported event-based Harris detector, and with no compromise on the accuracy of performance.\n[5]: The Event-Based Sensor (EBS) is a new class of imaging sensor where each pixel independently reports 'events' in response to changes in log intensity, rather than outputting image frames containing the absolute intensity at each pixel. Positive and negative events are emitted from the sensor when the change in log intensity exceeds certain controllable thresholds internal to the device. For objects moving through the field of view, a change in intensity can be related to motion. The sensor records events independently and asynchronously for each pixel with a very high temporal resolution, allowing the detection of objects moving very quickly through the field of view. Recently this type of sensor has been applied to the detection of orbiting space objects using a ground-based telescope. This paper describes a method to treat the data generated by the EBS as a classical detect-then-track problem by collating the events spatially and temporally to form target measurements. An efficient multi-target tracking algorithm, the probabilistic multi-hypothesis tracker (PMHT) is then applied to the EBS measurements to produce tracks. This method is demonstrated by automatically generating tracks on orbiting space objects from data collected by the EBS.",

The output rate of such cameras can reach up\u00c2\u00a0to 10 million events per second in high dynamic environments. DAVIS cameras use novel vision sensors that mimic human eyes. Their attractive attributes, such as high output rate, High Dynamic Range (HDR), and high pixel bandwidth, make them an ideal solution for applications that require high-frequency tracking. Moreover, applications that operate in challenging lighting scenarios can exploit from the high HDR of event cameras, i.e., 140 dB compared to 60 dB of traditional cameras. In this paper, a novel asynchronous corner tracking method is proposed that uses both events and intensity images captured by a DAVIS camera. The Harris algorithm is used to extract features, i.e., frame-corners from keyframes, i.e., intensity images. Afterward, a matching algorithm is used to extract event-corners from the stream of events. Events are solely used to perform asynchronous tracking until the next keyframe is captured. Neighboring events, within a window size of 5 \u00c3\u0097 5 pixels around the event-corner, are used to calculate the velocity and direction of extracted event-corners by fitting the 2D planar using a randomized Hough transform algorithm. Experimental evaluation showed that our approach is able to update the location of the extracted corners up\u00c2\u00a0to 100 times during the blind time of traditional cameras, i.e., between two consecutive intensity images. [4] Recently, the emerging bio-inspired event cameras have demonstrated potentials for a wide range of robotic applications in dynamic environments.

[7] Event-based cameras display great potential for a variety of tasks such as high-speed motion detection and navigation in low-light environments where conventional frame-based cameras suffer critically. This is attributed to their high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and low-power consumption. However, conventional computer vision methods as well as deep Analog Neural Networks (ANNs) are not suited to work well with the asynchronous and discrete nature of event camera outputs. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) serve as ideal paradigms to handle event camera outputs, but deep SNNs suffer in terms of performance due to the spike vanishing phenomenon. To overcome these issues, we present Spike-FlowNet, a deep hybrid neural network architecture integrating SNNs and ANNs for efficiently estimating optical flow from sparse event camera outputs without sacrificing the performance. The network is end-to-end trained with self-supervised learning on Multi-Vehicle Stereo Event Camera (MVSEC) dataset. Spike-FlowNet outperforms its corresponding ANN-based method in terms of the optical flow prediction capability while providing significant computational efficiency.",

The system's data acquisition, intelligent master controller, and actuators like fans and bulbs do not effectively make real-time adjustments based on feedback [1].\n #Reference: [1]: Sericulture (silk production) is a major occupation of rural community. Producing about 15% share of the world silk produce, India is the 2nd largest silk producer after China whose total produce amounts to a staggering 80%. Analysis of sericulture practices in India shows a clear need of automation especially during pre-cocoon stages. The silkworms undergo crucial bodily changes that determine the quality as well as quantity of the silk produce, during this phase. Maintenance of optimum values of abiotic factors, like temperature, humidity etc. thus yields a dramatic change in quantity and quality of silk produce. An Intelligent Sericulture plant automation system, using zone-based cascade control of physical parameters can be one of the solutions. Currently, such systems for pre-cocoon stages are purely manual, crude, and lack intelligence. The system comprises of a data acquisition sub-system corresponding to the predetermined zones for the rearing unit, an intelligent master controller facility, data repository of past corrective actions, and cheap actuators like fans, bulbs in the zones. The master control facilitates the optimum corrective action and directs the decisions to the identified actuator sub-system based on abiotic data obtained from the respective data acquisition sub-system. The actuator sub-system achieves the corrective measures using the actuators placed in that zone of the unit. A continuous real-time feedback facilitates accurate and quick implementation of corrective steps.

Such customized 3D printed constructs can be used for the regeneration of complex tissues such as cartilage, vessels, and nerves. However, the 3D printing techniques often offer limited control over the resolution and compromised mechanical properties due to short selection of printable inks. To address these limitations, we combined stereolithography and electrospinning techniques to fabricate a novel 3D biomimetic neural scaffold with a tunable porous structure and embedded aligned fibers. By employing two different types of biofabrication methods, we successfully utilized both synthetic and natural materials with varying chemical composition as bioink to enhance biocompatibilities and mechanical properties of the scaffold. The resulting microfibers composed of polycaprolactone (PCL) polymer and PCL mixed with gelatin were embedded in 3D printed hydrogel scaffold. Our results showed that 3D printed scaffolds with electrospun fibers significantly improve neural stem cell adhesion when compared to those without the fibers. Furthermore, 3D scaffolds embedded with aligned fibers showed an enhancement in cell proliferation relative to bare control scaffolds. More importantly, confocal microscopy images illustrated that the scaffold with PCL/gelatin fibers greatly increased the average neurite length and directed neurite extension of primary cortical neurons along the fiber.

Current bioprinting techniques and bioink formulations do not focus on fabricating perfusable vascular structures [9].\n #Reference: [9]: Despite the significant technological advancement in tissue engineering, challenges still exist towards the development of complex and fully functional tissue constructs that mimic their natural counterparts. To address these challenges, bioprinting has emerged as an enabling technology to create highly organized three-dimensional (3D) vascular networks within engineered tissue constructs to promote the transport of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products, which can hardly be realized using conventional microfabrication techniques. Here, we report the development of a versatile 3D bioprinting strategy that employs biomimetic biomaterials and an advanced extrusion system to deposit perfusable vascular structures with highly ordered arrangements in a single-step process. In particular, a specially designed cell-responsive bioink consisting of gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), sodium alginate, and 4-arm poly(ethylene glycol)-tetra-acrylate (PEGTA) was used in combination with a multilayered coaxial extrusion system to achieve direct 3D bioprinting. This blend bioink could be first ionically crosslinked by calcium ions followed by covalent photocrosslinking of GelMA and PEGTA to form stable constructs. The rheological properties of the bioink and the mechanical strengths of the resulting constructs were tuned by the introduction of PEGTA, which facilitated the precise deposition of complex multilayered 3D perfusable hollow tubes. This blend bioink also displayed favorable biological characteristics that supported the spreading and proliferation of encapsulated endothelial and stem cells in the bioprinted constructs, leading to the formation of biologically relevant, highly organized, perfusable vessels. These characteristics make this novel 3D bioprinting technique superior to conventional microfabrication or sacrificial templating approaches for fabrication of the perfusable vasculature.

This is not only a serious, but also a challenging task due to the complexities of the evacuees\u00e2\u0080\u0099 behaviors, route planning, and demanding coordination services. Although existing studies have addressed these challenges to some extent, mass evacuation in natural disasters tends to be difficult to predict and manage due to the limitation of the underlying models to capture realistic situations. It is therefore desirable to have on-demand mechanisms of locally-driven computing and data exchange services in order to enable near real-time capture of the disaster area during the evacuation. For this purpose, this paper comprehensively surveys recent advances in information and communication technology-enabled disaster evacuations, with the focus on fog computation and communication services to support a massive evacuation process. A numerous variety of tools and techniques are encapsulated within a coordinated on-demand strategy of an evacuation platform, which is aimed to provide a situational awareness and response. Herein fog services appear to be one of the viable options for responsive mass evacuation because they enable low latency data processing and dissemination. They can additionally provide data analytics support for autonomous learning for both the short-term guidance supports and long-term usages.

It uses information from fire protection systems, and calculates the optimal evacuation routes from real-time simulations to guide evacuees by dynamic signage through safest and fastest available paths. The proposed system was tested in a multi-enclosure building using participants. We found that 89% of participants followed the emergency exit signs. The reported results also indicate that the system may have a positive impact on evacuation time (reduced from 28.41% to 59.79% with the system). We also found that participants moved significantly faster when the system was in use. These findings support the hypothesis that, in practice, smart egress systems improve evacuation behaviour.

In this paper, we deal with the problem of an aggregator coordinating charging schedules of EVs with the objective of minimizing the total charging cost. In particular, unlike most previous studies, which assumed constant maximum charging power, we assume that the maximum charging power can vary according to the current state of charge (SOC). Under this assumption, we propose two charging schemes, namely non-preemptive and preemptive charging. The difference between these two is whether interruptions during the charging process are allowed or not. We formulate the EV charging-scheduling problem for each scheme and propose a formulation that can prevent frequent interruptions. Our numerical simulations compare different charging schemes and demonstrate that preemptive charging with limited interruptions is an attractive alternative in terms of both cost and practicality. We also show that the proposed formulations can be applied in practice to solve large-scale charging-scheduling problems.\n[7]: Electric vehicles today are getting more usable.

By using an evolutionary algorithm, a schedule is calculated that ensures that all electric vehicles are charged and that a given maximum peak power is not exceeded.

DC grid-based EV charging is more efficient than AC distribution because of its higher reliability, power conversion efficiency, simple interfacing with renewable energy sources (RESs), and integration of energy storage units (ESU). RES-generated power storage in local ESU is an alternative solution for managing the utility grid demand. In addition, to maintain the EV charging demand at the microgrid levels, energy management and control strategies must carefully power the EV battery charging unit.

RESULTS: The simulation results show that the adaptive PI-controller provides a reduction in the transient duration, but insufficient energy efficiency. Intelligent PI controller on the base of neuroregulator provides 2 times reduction of transition time, reduction of energy losses and engine overshoot. CONCLUSION: The use of the neuroregulator makes it possible to automatically select and adjust PI controller coefficients.

It monitors proper isolation check at initial stage that is before starting the vehicle and also during the continuous working. This control strategy ensures the proper stability and allows decoupling the system avoiding that the disturbances affect the battery terminal isolation and operation of on-board charger.",

Specialized Control Algorithms: Adaptive Fuzzy PID Control: This method provides better dynamic and static performance by adjusting PID parameters in real-time based on driving conditions. It is used for torque coordination and energy management in electric vehicles (EVs) [12].\n #Reference: [12]: This paper focuses on the control strategy of a plug-in 4-wheel-drive (4WD) hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV). To overcome the defects of the traditional proportion-integration-differentiation (PID) control method, an algorithm based on an adaptive fuzzy PID control method which provides better dynamic and static performances for the vehicle was adopted and a driver model was established using this algorithm. The input of the driver model was the difference between the cycle velocity and the actual output velocity of the vehicle. The output of the driver model was the required torque coefficient which reflects the driver's intention and thus can be used to calculate the actual required torque of the driver. The PID parameters can be revised real-time according to the change of the cycle conditions, and the principle to choose theses parameters to ensure the stability of the controller was introduced as well. The domain of discourse for the inputs and outputs of the fuzzy PID controller and their membership functions were analyzed and parts of the fuzzy rules were provided. The energy management control strategy based on engine optimal torque was adopted in order to improve the fuel economy of the vehicle. Because there was little possibility that the engine could drive the vehicle alone with the optimal engine output torque control strategy, and the general efficiency for the series mode was relatively low, the drive modes of the vehicle were only classified into four modes, including EV (electric vehicle) mode, parallel mode, 4WD mode, and E_charge (engine drives and charges the battery) mode. Mode judging rules and torque distribution methods were described, and a state-flow model in the paper was used to illustrate the energy management of the vehicle. In addition, a torque coordination control strategy based on \"engine speed regulation+clutch fuzzy PID control+ engine dynamic torque lookup+2 motor compensation\" was proposed. The engine dynamic torque related to the engine speed, throttle opening and its change rate were obtained by experiments, and they were fitted into a more detailed table through MATLAB programming. Aiming to have a more precise output oil pressure of the clutches, the two clutches were controlled by the combination of two fuzzy controllers and an adaptive fuzzy PID controller, and then a more reliable output of the required torque was obtained. One of the fuzzy controllers was used to calculate the oil pressure increment in the clutch, and the other was for the change rate of the original oil pressure. The fuzzy PID controller which was adaptive to different drive cycles was used to more accurately calculate the final oil pressure. The torque coordination control strategy was introduced by taking the transition between EV mode and parallel mode as an example. The detailed transition procedures were briefly introduced. The control strategy of the vehicle was simulated using hardware-in-loop(HIL) based on dSPACE with the cycle of 2*NEDC (which consists of two new European driving cycles) and the research results which include the output of the power components, SOC of the battery pack, and the velocity error which was reduced by 37.1% before and after the application of adaptive fuzzy PID indicate that the control strategy realized the basic energy management of the vehicle, and the jerk after the application of torque coordination control was reduced by 47.5% because of the coordination of the power components during mode transitions, and the adaptive fuzzy PID control of the two clutches. The control effectiveness of the control strategy was validated in this paper and it is of significance for controlling similar complicated hybrid systems.",

This research reports the effect of the Padang earthquake in terms of building damages and landslides that occured in the city of Padang, Padang Pariaman, Pariaman and Agam. Analysis on earthquake effects was carried out based on the geology, geotechnical, building damages and geohazards data collected from various sources and field works in affected areas. Results from field work showed that damages on the building structures in Padang and Padang Pariaman was due to the quality of construction which did not meet the building code and standard requirements, and the effect of geological conditions, i.e., ground amplification on deep layer of alluvial deposit. Some observed damage in the buildings were related to the building location constructed on the fault lines and soil or rock layers discontinuity. From the site visit, it was found that landslide cases which occurred in Pariaman and Agam after the earthquake were caused by the topography, geomorphology of area and steep slopes.

This problem has largely been neglected due to underreporting of losses and the dispersed nature of landslides. Understanding how populations cope with landslides is a first step toward developing more effective landslide risk management programs. The present research focuses on two villages in Central-Eastern Nepal, both affected by active landslides but with different coping strategies. Research methods are interdisciplinary, based on a geological assessment of landslide risk and a socio-economic study of the villages using household questionnaires, focus group discussions and transect walks. Community risk maps are compared with geological landslide risk maps to better understand and communicate community risk perceptions, priorities and coping strategies. A modified typology of coping strategies is presented, based on previous work by Burton, Kates, and White (1993) that is useful for decision-makers for designing more effective programs for landslide mitigation. Main findings underscore that coping strategies, mainly seeking external assistance and outmigration, are closely linked to access to resources, ethnicity/social status and levels of community organization. Conclusions include the importance of investing in organizational skills, while building on local knowledge about landslide mitigation for reducing landslide risk. There is great potential to increase coping strategies by incorporating skills training on landslide mitigation in existing agricultural outreach and community forest user group training. \u00c2\u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

It is suggested that electrophysiological systems share two key features with developmental systems that account for this dependence on regulatory evolution.

It is concluded that the relative balance of physical and computational tasks that a biological system has to perform, combined with the probability that these tasks may have to change significantly during the course of evolution, will be major factors in determining the relative mix of regulatory and structural evolution that is observed for a given system. Physiological systems that directly interface with the environment will almost always perform some low-level physical task. In the majority of cases this will require evolution of protein function in order for the tasks themselves to evolve. For complex physiological systems a large fraction of their function will be devoted to high-level control functions that are predominantly computational in nature.

For instance, liquid cooling systems with optimized serpentine microchannels can significantly improve temperature uniformity and reduce maximum temperatures, thereby enhancing safety [2].\n #Reference: [2]: Lithium-ion batteries are currently the primary source of power for electric vehicles (EVs), but the batteries are sensitive to temperature changes. Excessively high or low temperatures will affect the batteries performance, causing thermal runaway and safety accidents. The battery thermal management system (BTMS) can maintain the batteries within a safe temperature range. This paper studied a liquid cooling BTMS incorporating serpentine microchannels. Firstly, we studied the arrangement of the inlet direction of serpentine microchannel cooling plates. The research demonstrated that for plan 3 (i.e., inlet and outlet are staggered), the BTMS has the best cooling performance. The maximum temperature of plan 3 is 311.2592 K, which is 0.6892 K lower than plan 1. Then, we selected plan 3 as the baseline. The surrogate assisted approach was conducted to parameterize and model the selected scheme. After that, the multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) was used to optimize the parameters of the serpentine channel and water flow velocity. The optimization results indicated that the maximum temperature of the battery module dropped from 311.2592 K to 308.6067 K, the maximum pressure decreased from 578.9111 Pa to 502.0554 Pa, the average temperature decreased from 308.7952 K to 306.0020 K. After optimization, the temperature uniformity of the battery module is significantly improved, which provides guidance for improving the heat dissipation performance of the serpentine liquid cooling BTMS. Especially, the maximum pressure decreased by 13.28%, which can reduce the pumping power of the cooling water in the channel, and the consumption of energy of the EVs.",

This work deals with the common case of large mechanical systems, such as trains, aircrafts, helicopters etc., which can be modelled considering two main sub-structures: the source structure, corresponding for example to the machines/engines, and the receiving structure, corresponding for example to the accommodation areas/cabin. Under operating conditions, the source generates unwanted noise and vibrations in the receiver. Numerical models are highly desired at a design stage for predicting the vibro-acoustic behaviour of the receiver and for design optimisation. In order to develop such models, sub-structuring techniques may be used for evaluating the power transmitted from the source to the receiver at the connecting points. In this work a frequency response coupling technique (or impedance coupling technique) is applied for the prediction of the complex power transmitted between a source-structure and a receiving-structure in a multi-pointconnection case. The data required are the frequency response functions (FRFs) of the source and the receiver and the velocity at the connecting points under operating conditions. A numerical and an experimental case are shown.\n[2]: The article describes the sources of mechanical vibration and noise, their effect on the human body, machines and structures, and methods of minimization of the vibration and noise. Also presented are the methods of calculation of dynamic loads induced by the vibrating machines and affecting the support structures and foundations, as well as the ways of minimizing their influence by vibration isolation. Calculations and methods of selection of such vibration-isolation elements like springs, rubber pads and active pneumatic cushions, are also included.\n[3]: This paper presents computational methods that are used by rolling stock manufacturers to predict noise inside vehicles. For airborne transmission, which dominates in the medium-high frequency range, a four-step procedure is applied: source description by their emitted sound power level, propagation of noise to the train\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s exterior surface, panel transmission loss and acoustic response of the interior cavity. Reasonable agreement between computations and measurements is usually obtained, and the method makes it possible to rank the different source contributions and airborne transmission paths. Structure borne noise dominates in low frequencies. Finite Element models are used to improve car body design (dynamic stiffness at input points and carbody vibroacoustic transfers), but they do not cover the whole problem since the modelling of excitation from the bogie is not included. Recent research allowing the computation of blocked forces at car body input points and starting with wheel/rail interaction is briefly presented.

This method involves adjusting the satellite's ballistic coefficient to achieve desired miss distances from potential collisions [9].\n #Reference: [9]: The increasing number of actors in space has led to an increased risk of on-orbit collisions. Predictions have shown that if action is not taken to mitigate the risks of collisions in space, the additional debris resulting from these collisions may render space unusable for generations to come. This reality necessitates that future spacecraft take an active role in debris mitigation and collision avoidance instead of contributing to the problem. Large satellites containing propulsion systems have utilized thrusters to actively avoid debris objects as well as to perform post-mission disposal burns. However, many small satellites such as CubeSat do not contain propulsion systems and generally do not perform active collision avoidance or post-mission disposal. Drag devices have been developed for small satellites to expedite post-mission de-orbit, but the significantly increased surface area from a drag device greatly increases the risk of an on-orbit collision per unit time. For satellites containing retractable drag devices such as the Drag De-Orbit Device (D3) developed at the University of Florida, aerodynamic drag modulations can be used for active collision avoidance, mitigating the increased collision risk caused by the larger surface area. This paper discusses a means of calculating the necessary drag profile for active collision avoidance that can be applied to any satellite capable of modulating its ballistic coefficient. An analytical solution is first developed relating changes in the drag profile of a satellite to perturbations in the future orbit of the satellite. This analytical solution is then used to estimate the ballistic coefficient profile a satellite must follow to achieve a desired miss distance from an impending collision with the minimum amount of time spent maneuvering. Numerical methods and a high-fidelity orbit propagator are utilized to refine this estimate. This paper also presents an analysis of the aerodynamic collision avoidance capabilities of a satellite based on its orbital regime and drag modulation capabilities. In the perceived application of this theory, a satellite operator receives a conjunction notice indicating a potential collision several days in the future. Based on a risk assessment, the satellite operator determines a desired miss distance from the debris object and uses the aforementioned theory to compute and apply the drag modulation necessary to achieve this orbit adjustment with minimal interruptions to nominal satellite operations.",

Most of the existing researches treat the plate structures as beams. This work, however, models rotating structures as plates. At the same time, the existing research shows that the constrained layer damping (CLD) is an effective technique for vibration suppressions. Through the models investigated, this paper develops a single layer plate finite element model for a constrained layer damped rotating plate to improve both the accuracy and versatility over previous beam CLD models. Due to the multiple design variables and complex responses, a genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to determine the thicknesses of the viscoelastic damping layer and the constraining layer so that the amplitudes with first two modes of the driving point mobility at a selected point of the rotating plate can be minimized. Numerical results show that GA works effectively with developed single layer plate finite element model to find out the optimum configuration. \u00c2\u00a9 JVE INTERNATIONAL LTD.",

Living in such a SBE, where for example, the furniture can rearrange itself, and the doors open and close of their own volition, may be difficult and unpredictable. Furthermore, cyber-security attacks and intrusion could allow attackers to assume control of the SBE, damage its components and to potentially harm its inhabitants. Such novel characteristics of SBEs present developers with several unique challenges with regards to implementing the needed safety and security measures and protocols that go along with them. With such environments, therefore, there is a need for a system that is capable of monitoring user activities in real-time, identifying the safety and security hazards to users in their immediate local context, warning users of these hazards, and perhaps even taking preventative and mitigative action against the hazards that it identified. In this paper, we survey some of these challenges and explore the design and implementation of a system designed around the safety and security of SBE inhabitants. We propose an approach to modeling SBE safety that combines the three laws of robotics and the swarm behavior model. We also present a preliminary prototype and discuss a case study.",

Crank-resolved spectral representation of the AE is also given but rigorous investigation of the AE spectral qualities is left to future study. Cycle-to-cycle statistical dispersion of the AE signal is considered to highlight highly variable engine processes. Engine speed was held constant but load conditions are varied to investigate AE signal sensitivity to operating condition.

Customers demand more complex and reliable products to be developed with shorter lead times and more cost effectiveness; Environmental and regulatory constraints as well as market expectations demand more efficient product behavior.

In this study, the effect of material properties of underfill and EMC, such as Young's modulus and CTE, are investigated through FEM simulation. In the FEM analysis, the warpage of the package, the maximum principle stress in the die and the maximum shear stress on the interface between the substrate, undefill and EMC's surface are considered. Experimental investigation on the warpage measurement of the package is carried out to verify the simulation results. In addition, some geometry parameters, such as the underfill's profile and EMC thickness, are also considered as the influencing parameters for the reliability of the package. Process optimization study, i.e., replacing underfill with EMC, is also carried out to improve the manufacturing process. The results show that the reliability of the system in package is closely related to the material properties and the geometry structures of underfill and EMC. The replacement of underfill with EMC improves the reliability performance of the package significantly. Results of this study provide a good guidance for the structure/process design and material selection when developing a SiP module. \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a92007 IEEE.",

Thus, the urban transportation has become a critical part of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The excessive dependence of urban transportation on high-emission fuels is the main obstacle to develop a low-carbon transport. Meanwhile, natural gas is a bridge fuel to develop a low-emission transport. To the best of our knowledge, there has been little attention towards the association between the development of natural gas-fueled vehicles and the CO2 emission. Therefore, the problem we studied is the role of compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles in replacing high-emission fuels. In this study, we aimed to study this association by selecting the system dynamics approach due to the complexities of the social-economic system of transportation. In this modeling, different subsystems of the transport fleet were employed including CNG vehicles and urban transportation subsystems. Iran has used CNG as an alternative fuel in the transportation sector, making it one of the three leading countries in the use of natural gas in the urban transportation system. Our case study is focused on Tehran, which is the capital and the largest city of Iran. In this paper, we considered several scenarios to replace the gasoline fuel in the private car sector and taxis and diesel fuel in the bus fleet with natural CNG fuel. The results show that the replacement of CNG fuel with high-emission fuels can have a significant effect on reducing CO2 emissions. In the synthetic scenario, CO2 emission will be decreased by 11.42% in 2030, as compared to the business as usual (BAU) scenario in this year. According to Iran's commitment to the Paris Agreement, the emission of CO2 in Iran should normally be reduced by 4% in 2030, as compared to its amount in the BAU scenario. Therefore, Iran can easily fulfill its obligations in the urban transport sector only by replacing gasoline and diesel fuel with CNG. ",

        "input": "#Claim: Nitrogen Oxides (NOx): The impact on NOx emissions can vary. CNG engines can reduce NOx emissions, but under certain conditions, NOx emissions may increase [8, 9].\n #Reference: [8]: Changes in temperature and pressure influence the operational conditions of motor vehicles using Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) fuel. Therefore, engine torque and exhaust emissions (CO, CO<inf>2</inf>, NO<inf>x</inf> and hydrocarbons) were tested to determine the effects of altering initial temperature and pressure of CNG prior to entering the combustion chamber of an Otto engine. It was found that variations in initial temperature and pressure do not affect torque. Increased gas temperature leads to decreased contents of CO, HC (hydrocarbons) and NO<inf>x</inf> but increased C02 in exhaust gas. Meanwhile, increase in gas pressure is associated with decreased C02, HC and NO<inf>x</inf> but increased CO in exhaust gas. Based on experimental results, it is clear that fuel gas temperature and pressure do not affect the engine torque but affect the exhaust gas composition.\n[9]: The use of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) has demonstrated the potential to decrease Particulate Matter (PM) and nitrogen oxide (NO<inf>x</inf>) emissions simultaneously when used in a dual-fuel application with diesel fuel functioning as the ignition source. However, some authors do find that NO<inf>x</inf> emissions can increase. One postulation is that the conflicting results in the literature may be due to the difference in composition of natural gas around the world. Therefore, in order to investigate if CNG composition influences combustion performance and emissions, four unique mixtures of CNG were tested (i.e., 87% to 96% methane) while minimizing the combined difference of the density, heating value, and constant pressure specific heat of each mixture. This was accomplished at moderate energy substitution ratios (up to 40%) in a single cylinder engine operating at various loads. Previous analysis of these results did not reveal noticeable macroscopic trends with respect to the relative amounts of methane, ethane, propane, and isobutane. Thus, a statistical analysis using 2-way and 1-way Analysis of Variance along with Pearson correlations was performed to determine if dependencies exist between the results and the composition of CNG. It was found that the loading and substitution rate dominated the results with a relatively small influence noted from the amount of methane on the hydrocarbon emissions. As a result, the CNG composition normalization procedure employed may provide a simple methodology of ensuring consistent performance and emission results from different CNG compositions when used in a dual-fuel manner with diesel.",

They are widely used in the fields of transportation, construction machinery, agricultural machinery, ships and small machinery. In the face of the challenges of energy saving and environment protection, high-efficient and low-pollution combustion mode has become the development direction of DI diesel engines. The combustion process of DI diesel engines determines the thermal efficiency and the emission levels, while the combustion process is determined by the atomization and mixing process of the fuel. During the operating process of the engine, atomization and mixing of the fuel are controlled by the injection parameters such as the injection pressure and the nozzle diameter of the injector as well as the environmental parameters such as background temperature and environmental density. Therefore, studying the influence of fuel injection parameters and environmental parameters on fuel spray characteristics is of great significance for optimizing the design of combustion system. In this paper, the sensitivity analysis on the effect of background temperatures and densities on the diesel spray characteristics in the previous study was summarized. A direct imaging and schlieren technique of high-speed photography and an image processing program were used to analyze the sensitivities of injection pressure and nozzle diameter to spray parameters. The influence of the injection parameters (injection pressure, nozzle diameter) and ambient parameters (background temperature, background density) on the spray characteristics was compared according to the sensitivity analysis results. The results show that under the experimental conditions (background temperature of 304-770 K, background density of 13-26 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, nozzle diameter of 0.18-0.26 mm, injection pressure of 120-160 MPa), with the decrease of nozzle diameter, the volume percentage of gas phase tends to increase, and the mean excess air coefficient of the spray also increases. The reason is mainly that as the nozzle diameter decreases, the droplet size decreases, the spray surface area increases, and evaporation becomes faster. With the increase of injection pressure, the volume percentage of gas phase tends to increase, and the mean excess air coefficient of the spray also increases. The reason for this is that with the increase of injection pressure, the speed of oil droplet breaking is faster, the amount of air entrained by the spray is increased, the relative speed between spray and ambient gas increases, and the heat transfer through convection increases, which are beneficial to the evaporation of the spray. It can be found from the sensitivity analysis of gas phase volume percent that the background temperature has the highest sensitivity (3.3) to gas phase volume percent, followed by the injection parameters that can affect the crushing process: nozzle diameter (-0.29) and fuel injection pressure (0.23). The effect of background density on the gas phase volume percent has the lowest sensitivity (0.12). It can be found from the sensitivity analysis of average excess air coefficient that the injection parameters (nozzle diameter (-2.24) and injection pressure (1.29)) have higher sensitivity to the average air excess coefficient, while the environmental parameters (background temperature (0.69) and background density (0.71)) have a slightly lower average effect on the average excess air coefficient.\n[3]: An experimental study on spray characteristics of ultra high pressure common rail system was conducted based on self-designed spray experimental platform. The effects of fuel injection pressure and fuel injection law on the spray characteristics of marine diesel engine were analyzed in aspects of fuel bundle shape, spray penetration and spray cone angle systemically and quantitatively, which provides theoretical basis for further improve the performance of marine diesel engine. The results show that the variable pressure and fuel injection rate injection can be realized by controlling the opening time of electric-controlled pressure amplifier solenoid valve and injector solenoid valve in ultra high pressure common rail system. With the rise of fuel injection pressure, the fuel bundle break up and evaporation phenomenon, spray penetration as well as spray cone angle all increase gradually, however, when the fuel injection pressure is more than 200 MPa, influence of fuel injection pressure on the spray penetration and spray cone angle becomes smaller and smaller. With the fuel injection law varies from rectangular to saddle-shaped, the fuel bundle break up and evaporation phenomenon, spray penetration as well as spray cone angle all decrease gradually, and the spray penetration of rectangular fuel injection law under 150 MPa fuel injection pressure is larger than that of saddle-shaped fuel injection law under 200 MPa fuel injection pressure, which further indicates that the initial pressure is the most important factor to determine spray penetration.",

To study the mechanism of damage generation during drilling of carbon/epoxy composites and titanium alloy stacks, both traditional drilling and orbital drilling were used. Because the cutting parameters of the two drilling processes were different from each other, an appropriate comparing method was proposed based on the analysis of kinematics of orbital drilling and traditional drilling. The results show that high cutting temperature is the main reason for the damage generation during drilling of composite/titanium stacks. Cutting heat generated during machining of titanium alloy conducts to the composites and leads to the increase of composite temperature. High cutting temperature induces the degradation of carbon/epoxy composite properties, which results in the generation of damage during machining of composites. The cutting force in axial direction during orbital drilling is generally as high as that during traditional drilling. However, the temperature during orbital drilling is 36.3% less than that during traditional drilling. High cutting temperature and continuous chip generated during traditional drilling cause the high hole-wall roughness of titanium alloy.

For biomedical applications such as orthopedic implants it is required that near zero defects surface is ensured.This work studies Electropolishing of solution annealed and cold rolled 316L stainless steel and characterizes the surface physically for roughness, topography and electrochemically for localized corrosion. Characterization techniques involve Profilometry, Specular reflection, SEM, AFM, Ellipsometry, XPS, polarization studies in Hank's solution, and Micro- cell Ecorr noise studies to estimate localized corrosion resistance. The results are compared with nitric acid passivated 316L stainless steel surfaces also.

In addition, Surface roughness described only in terms of Ra values may not truly describe the extremely large hills or valleys as expressed by the parameters like Rz, and Rmax. AFM studies revealed the existence of equiaxed peculiar 'diamond' shaped feature (cell width roughly 100nm) upon solution annealed and electropolished sample surface whereas cold rolled and electropolished sample surfaces exhibited 'striped' feature.

Electropolishing is a technique in which the surface roughness is eliminated through a selective electrochemical dissolution. The effect of electropolishing on pitting corrosion of 304 stainless steel (SS) was investigated employing polarization technique in conjunction with the scanning electron microcopy examination. Electropolishing process was carried out on wire of 2 mm diameter in 70% phosphoric acid solution at room temperature for 30 min. To elucidate the effect of roughness elimination on pitting corrosion, investigation was carried out on as-received specimen with surface finishing of 60 SiC grit and electropolished specimen in 0.5M NaCl solution at room temperature. A significant decrease on passive current density and also shift of pitting potential towards noble value was recorded on electropolished specimen revealing a pronounce effect of this technique on surface modification. Further investigation was carried out by employing slow ramp anodic potentiodynamic polarization on as received and electropolished specimen. Plot of metastable pitting current transient revealed the reduction on the number and magnitude of metastable pitting transients prior to occurrence of stable pitting on electropolished specimen. EDX analysis of the surface area of as received and electropolished specimens showed modification in surface roughness during electropolishing was the main reason of pitting corrosion improvement. Scanning microscopy investigation of polarized specimens beyond the pitting potential revealed that in as-receives specimen pits were nucleated in at and in the vicinity of surface scratches that was created during surface abrading.\n[7]: For the biomedical application of NiTi alloys, an excellent surface finishing process is required to guarantee high corrosion resistance and biocompatibility, eliminating the allergenic and toxic effects associated with the release of nickel ions in the body. Electropolishing is a process that can reduce surface imperfections and form a thin protective layer of TiO<inf>2</inf>, even in complex-shaped devices.

This project aimed to deliver value through lean design, quality in sustainability, and certification according to German standards for passive houses [4].\n #Reference: [4]: Demonstration projects are often used in the building sector to provide a basis for using new processes and/or products. The climate change agenda implies that construction is not only required to deliver value for the customer, cost reductions and efficiency but also sustainable buildings. This paper reports on an early demonstration project, the building of a passive house dormitory in the Central Region of Denmark in 2006-2009. The project was supposed to deliver value, lean design, prefabrication, quality in sustainability, certification according to German standards for passive houses, and micro combined heat and power using hydrogen. Using sociological and business economic theories of innovation, the paper discusses how early movers of innovation tend to obtain only partial success when demonstrating their products and often feel obstructed by minor details. The empirical work encompasses both an evaluation of the design and construction process as well as a post-occupancy evaluation. Process experiences include the use of a multidisciplinary competence group and performance measurement. The commencement of the project was enthusiastic, but it was forced into more traditional forms of control, driven by such challenges as complying with cost goals, the need to choose a German prefab supplier, and local contractors. Energy calculations, indoor climate, issues related to square meter requirements, and the hydrogen element became problematic. The aim to obtain passive house certification prevailed over realizing a good indoor climate, which included sufficient heating. Project management must be able to handle quantitative complexity where simple issues add up to major challenges. \u00c2\u00a9 Koch and Bertelsen; Licensee Bentham Open.",

Precast concrete crosswall is an offsite technology encouraged for use for multi-storey developments. However, the uptake of crosswall is slow, which constitutes a risk to long-term housing delivery. This paper addresses this risk by revealing an insight into the utilisation of crosswall for multistorey residential buildings in the organisational context. The paper reports on longitudinal case study research of 20 crosswall buildings, consisting of 1930 apartments in total, constructed by a leading UK housebuilder in recent five years. The case study involved document analysis and personal interviews with the company and their supply chains. The rationale for utilising crosswall included considerations of design, technical, commercial, procurement and construction. The primary driver was simplicity from both procurement and contractual aspects, which enabled the developer to construct buildings up to 20 storeys without engaging specialist main contractors. Other benefits included reduced on-site duration, enhanced quality of finish, reduced waste, improved health and safety and cost savings, whilst issues existed in design, procurement and construction. To fully realise the potential benefits from utilising crosswall requires modifications to existing design process and supply chain management and cultural support to innovation and learning. Strategies are developed from the longitudinal learning process. They should encourage the uptake of crosswall and improve quality and efficiency of housing supply in the future.",

Systems owned by several organizations local authorities, bus operators, car park operators and others, are aggregated into one super system to their mutual benefit with a saving on infrastructure and the development of additional functions at no or minimal cost. EC had recognized a need for both improvement in transportation-management and a desire to have cross border standardization. A series of transportation frameworks were set up. Each of these had specific aims and international consortia had to bid to provide projects that conformed to the aims of the framework. In reality the EC grant only paid for the EC overheads, but did open doors to other grants that could pay for new transportation services.\n[6]: Driver behavior plays an important role in urban roadway safety, signal control and traffic management, etc\u00e2\u008b\u00af In this paper, an Intelligent Vehicle-Infrastructure Integration Experimental Platform was first established, and with the guidance of the platform architecture, three subsystems: intelligent vehicle subsystem, signal controller subsystem, communication subsystem are designed in detail. Furthermore, with the real-time vehicle GPS experimental data obtained from this platform, we analyzed driver behavior at the intersection.=when the traffic signal display is red, green and the time the vehicle trapping in dilemma zone, then all above were summarized, which will have far-reaching significant impact on the research of actively safety and signal control at intersection in Chinese urban area in the future. \u00c2\u00a9 2009 IEEE.\n[7]: With the advent of intelligent transportation systems, vehicles will connect continuously to the Internet via the vehicular core network or the cellular network. Opening vehicles systems to the Internet aims at improving vehicles safety and comfort via the development of remote services for drivers assistance. Such services are for example infotainment applications, software update over the air, remote diagnostics and adaptive insurance. However, some of these services come with an inherent problem of privacy as they require as inputs the private data from the vehicles. In this work, we investigate the use of homomorphic encryption for ensuring the confidentiality of vehicles private data. We study the confidentiality of data, which are treated by external service providers such as cars manufacturers, their stakeholders and insurances. Our protocol ensures, by design, the private treatment of vehicles data thanks to homomorphic encryption properties. We validate our proposal by studying drivers behaviour using a simple neural network that takes as input drivers pictures and tells whether a driver is concentrated or distracted. Indeed, we rely on a 3 layers network for classifying drivers behavior in 10 different classes from normal to dangerous. We use a quadratic activation function for intermediate layers which contain 20 and 10 units, respectively. Meanwhile, we use a sigmoid activation function for the last layer which contains 10 units, one per label. Our classification takes 11 seconds with a classification accuracy of 86% and 25 seconds with a classification accuracy of 92%.",

This includes developing more efficient, safe, and comfortable vehicles [4, 16].\n #Reference: [4]: There are over 600 million vehicles on the world's roads with another 60 million vehicles produced annually worldwide. It is estimated that around two thirds of available oil production is used in transportation, whereby road vehicles alone consume around 40%. The automotive industry consumes approximately 15% of the world's steel, 40% of the world's rubber and 25% of the world's glass, with the consumption of raw materials and other resources further growing due to rapid development in China and India. In addition, transportation accounts for around 25% of greenhouse emissions worldwide, whereby 90% of transport related emissions come from road vehicles, predominantly cars. Clearly, current levels of consumption and emissions are unsustainable. Therefore, it is of paramount importance that sustainability considerations including environmental, economic and social are systematically addressed in vehicle design and development targeting all aspects of the vehicle system. Car seats represent a critical vehicle sub-system, due to the wide range of functions and standards they are required to satisfy, including safety, ergonomics and aesthetics. In addition, there are increasing demands for higher product quality and increased performance with reduced cost and time to market. As well as stakeholder requirements derived from customer and market trends, there is an increasing need to satisfy automotive environmental legislation. These complex requirements cannot be met without a systematic knowledge-based engineering design approach supported by the implementation of effective design tools and methods. This paper applies a systematic approach to sustainable car seat design using the modified Quality Function Deployment (QFD) method as an integrating medium for customer requirements and technical characteristics. The design methodology presented in this paper is derived from research and development projects on the sustainable design of a car seat assembly in collaboration with the relevant manufacturer. The customer requirements and technical characteristics associated with this project have been integrated within a modified QFD process. This has enabled identification of the key technical characteristics of a new sustainable product. Environmental assessment has been completed by reverse engineering an existing seat assembly and applying Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to further understand the identified key technical characteristics and their impact on environmental performance of the product. Based on the outcomes of this approach, opportunities for competitive advantage have been identified, including mass reduction and function innovation, and applied in the design and development of new generation products.\n[16]: Transportation is one of the furthermost indispensable commercial properties in the modern world. An effective method of transportation safeguards the movement of individuals and product distribution could be directed in a safe and well-timed method. To meet this obligation, numerous categories and representations of vehicles were shaped by automotive companies to accomplish the requirements of customers especially in the background of passenger vehicles. Today's the modern global automotive industry encompasses the principal manufacturers, General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Honda, Volkswagen, and Daimler Chrylser, all of which operate in a global competitive marketplace. All automotive industries especially car manufacturers are required to increase their market segment with corporate profit to ensure cost related objectives and success over competitors. It is therefore essential for auto firms to reconsider their product development methodology in order to fulfil the objectives. In future, it is forecasted that the passenger's mobility is going to be increase further, in such a case a study has been conducted to know the production of passenger's vehicle for their mobility. The study is prepared grounded on primary facts and secondary statistics. The primary data has collected through oral interview from stalwarts of automotive industry. The secondary facts is composed from the information of OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) Transport Out Look Report of automotive industry and all existing literature has collected also from internet automotive websites, auto business magazines, e-auto journals etc. findings out the study reveals that there is growing demand for car in future at global level .

With advancements in model checkers and other formal techniques, large designs can be verified in a partial or semi-formal manner. However, it is well known that exhaustive exploration of design state space is still prohibitive. In this paper, we revisit the concept of guided state space exploration which holds the promise of complete formal verification. Since it is not trivial to devise guidance strategies in an automatic manner, identification of the guidance hints becomes very crucial for a directed traversal of the state space. This directed traversal can ultimately reduce the time spent in formal verification and also assist in better design debugging. We propose a methodology for identification of such guideposts and utilize them for debugging purpose. Our goal is to achieve faster counter-example generation by the usage of guideposts.

[20] Objective: To develop and validate a clinical tool based on the biomechanical strategies exhibited by people with hemiparesis due to stroke during the performance of the Timed \"Up and Go\" test. Design/methods: The Timed \"Up and Go\" Assessment of Biomechanical Strategies (TUG-ABS) was developed for subjects with stroke, based on the analyses of 3 sources of information: published evidence; opinions of rehabilitation professionals; and observations of TUG performances, followed by a multi-step approach, which involved the investigation of the reliability, content, and criterion-related validity of the preliminary version. Content validity was established by an expert panel, whereas intra- and inter-rater reliability was established by two independent examiners. Criterion-related validity was established by comparing the TUG-ABS scores at the item level obtained by independent analyses of video observations and the gold standard motion analysis system. The final tool included the items, which showed acceptable values for these psychometric properties. Results: The preliminary version consisted of 24 items with 3 response categories. Twenty-one items showed acceptable content validity (0.72 \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 ? \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 1.00; p \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 0.01), 19 acceptable intraand inter-rater reliability (0.36 \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 ? \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 1.00; p \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 0.04), and 15 acceptable criterion-related validity (0.29 \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 ? \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 1.00; p \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 0.04).

Specialized Methods: Design Rule Checking (DRC): In semiconductor manufacturing, DRC validates layout geometries against design rules to ensure manufacturability [9].\n #Reference: [9]: Accurately and efficiently verifying the device layout is a crucial step in semiconductor manufacturing. A single missed design violation carries the potential for a disastrous and avoidable yield loss. Typically, design rule checking (DRC) is accomplished by validating drawn layout geometries against pre-determined rules, the specifics of which are derived empirically or from lithographic first principles. These checks are intrinsically rigid, and, taken together, a set of DRC rules only approximate the manufacturable design space in the crudest manner. Process-specific effects are entirely neglected. But for leading-edge technologies, process variations significantly impact the manufacturability of a design, so traditional DRC becomes increasingly difficult to implement, or worse, speciously inaccurate. Fortunately, the rise of Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) has given manufacturers a means to accurately model optical and process effects, and, therefore, an opportunity to introduce this information into the layout validation flow. We demonstrate an enhanced, full-chip DRC technique, which utilizes process models to locate marginal or bad design features and classify them according to severity.",

In many cases, the intervention is realized using composite materials bonded to the surface of the structural element. In many masonry structures the use of fabric reinforced cementitious matrices (FRCM) is preferred to the fiber reinforced polymers (FRP). The typical experimental stress-strain behavior exhibited by a FRCM composite under a direct tensile test is a tri-linear curve with a first phase that increases linearly according to mortar Young's modulus, a second phase where the cracks in the mortar start to grow, and a last phase in which the mortar is fully cracked and the curve assumes the same slope of the stiffness of the fabric. According to a wide experimental campaign conducted on the subject at the Politecnico di Milano, the curves exhibit a relatively wide scatter, especially in the second phase, making the standardization of the direct tensile test a rather difficult task. With the aim of having an insight into the observed experimental variability, a comprehensive FE numerical analysis was conducted and is presented in this paper. Two different FE codes were utilized. One with less sophisticated material models, the second with the possibility to deal with softening and damage in the post peak range. The use of commercial codes instead of home-made models was voluntary, with the precise final aim of enabling other researchers the reproduction of results with similar models and for analogous experiments. Three different variables that can affect the mechanical behavior in tension were examined (non-planarity of the composite grid, bending of the specimen and pre-existing micro-cracks), leading to three different sets of simulations. A final objective of the numerical simulation was to study and compare possible constitutive models for the cementitious matrix to simulate the experiments. At this aim, three different material models were used for mortar belonging to FRCM specimens in tension.

Differences of coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) between mortar and coarse aggregate, autogenous shrinkage of mortar and size of coarse aggregate were important factors influencing deterioration. The tensile strength of concrete was severely affected by the extent of microcracks. Concrete using ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) suffered worse damage than concrete prepared from ordinary Portland cement alone. Attempts were made to apply the acoustic emission (AE) technique to study the process and mechanism of microcracking. The skills required to practice the AE technique at early ages and at high temperature were carefully considered. AE hits agreed with the test results for deformation and tensile strength. Most of the microcracks occurred within the descending period of temperature and were classified into tensile mode. The use of coarse aggregate with larger CTE, saturated fine lightweight aggregate, and the reduction of the maximum size of the aggregate were greatly effective in reducing microcracking and improving the tensile strength of concrete made with GGBFS. Direct tensile strength was more adversely affected by microcracking than splitting tensile strength.

Based on the mechanical tests and analysis of the microstructure, a new optimal mix proportion of UHPC was also developed by considering the economic benefits.

Changes of radiative and convective heat transfer from the flame to the environment or solid fuel surfaces due to vitiation need be better understood. This work presents an experimental study on the radiative characteristics of buoyant turbulent ethylene diffusion flames burning in a nitrogen-diluted atmosphere. The experiment was performed on a 15-cm diameter poollike ethylene fire enclosed in a water-cooled compartment. The ambient oxygen concentration was controlled by adding nitrogen to the air flow while maintaining the oxygen flow rate at ten times of the stoichiometric oxidant requirement of the flames. The fuel supply rate was constant while the ambient oxygen concentrations were reduced from atmospheric condition to 8 vol %. At different ambient oxygen concentrations, the radiant fraction, combustion efficiency, flame shape, and temperature along the central axis of the flame were measured. In addition, the radiative power per unit height was determined by measuring the radiative heat flux of flame sections using a slit radiometer, which facilitates the interpretation of radiant fraction. The global soot volume fraction and temperature were also determined by coupling measured spectral flame emission and RADCAL modeling. It was found that the radiant fraction reduces with decreasing ambient oxygen concentrations, which was mainly attributed to reduced soot concentration.",

Effective evaluation requires at temperature studies for blood contacting medical devices for the following purposes: wear characteristics, thermal expansion, and temperature effects on sensors in the design. The task was to control the fluid within an ISO5198 hydraulic loop used to evaluate left ventricular assist devices at a given temperature between 95F and 105F. The design was to function within one degree Fahrenheit. This task was accomplished utilizing a microcontroller, the PowerSwitch Tail II, a DS18B20 waterproof temperature sensor, and an immersion heater. To manage heat loss from the piping section of the loop foam piping insulation was installed to all non-testing sections. The group was able to successfully thermally regulate temperature in the loop for a range of flow rates (2-10 LPM). The team utilized a pulsing control architecture to keep overshoot within the system to a minimum. The system takes approximately 6 mins to come to temperature with approximately a one degree overshoot. The longest recorded success of controlling the loop within a plus or minus one degree accuracy is approximately 2 hours. A computational model of the system was made using the thermofluid blocks of the Simulink Simscape foundation library. Approximated heat loss is roughly 70 W for the entire circuit, which equates to one degree Fahrenheit drop for every five minutes without heat input.

However, using wireless communications technology in a healthcare environment poses two major challenges. First, the electromagnetic interference caused to bio-medical devices by wireless devices could critically affect their performance. Second, since different types of e-health applications have different priorities, access to the wireless channel by the corresponding devices needs to be prioritized. In this article we introduce a novel cognitive-radio-based approach to address these challenges in wireless communications for e-health applications in a hospital environment. First, the requirements for a wireless communications system to be used in a healthcare environment are identified, and potential applications of cognitive radio technology for e-health applications are discussed. Then a cognitive radio system is proposed for e-health applications in a hospital environment, which protects the medical devices from harmful interference by adapting the transmit power of wireless devices based on EMI constraints. An EMI-aware handshaking protocol is proposed for channel access by two different types of applications with different priorities. The performance of this cognitive radio system for e-health applications is evaluated through simulations. \u00c2\u00a9 2010 IEEE.\n[4]: Wireless communications promises to serve as a key medical technology by automating patient monitoring and greatly improving the accuracy of readings compared to written records. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and ZigBee are three types of wireless interfaces that can be useful in connected medical devices. Each uses a portion of the industrial/scientific/medical (ISM) radio bands that are reserved internationally for the use of unlicensed devices. Each is covered by industry standards and industry consortiums that help ensure the interoperation of devices made by different manufacturers. Bluetooth provides the simplest type of wireless link for a medical device, a one-to-one connection (typically) between the medical device and some other device. Wi-Fi can easily handle the large amounts of data involved. However, Wi-Fi consumes significantly more power than Bluetooth. ZigBee creates self-forming, self-healing wireless mesh networks that allow all participating devices to communicate with one another and act as repeaters to transfer data between devices.",

Background Teaching wireless communications and networking is not an easy task because it involves broad subjects and abstract content. Methodology A pedagogical method that combined lectures, labs, assignments, exams, and readings was applied in a course of wireless communications. Contribution Five wireless networking labs, related to wireless local networks, wireless securi-ty, and wireless sensor networks, were developed for students to complete all of the required hands-on lab activities. Findings Both development and implementation of the labs achieved a successful out-come and provided students with a very effective learning experience. Students expressed that they had a better understanding of different wireless network technologies after finishing the labs. Recommendations for Practitioners Detailed instructional lab manuals should be developed so that students can carry out hands-on activities in a step-by-step fashion. Recommendation for Researchers Hands-on lab exercises can not only help students understand the abstract technical terms in a meaningful way, but also provide them with hands-on learn-ing experience in terms of wireless network configuration, implementation, and evaluation.

The booming application of wireless communication and its fast developing technology have caused significant social and technological impacts. Despite its rising importance, wireless communication and wireless networks are not commonly studied in an Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology program. As a part of our curriculum continuous improvement plan, faculty members in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology department at the University of Cincinnati felt it very important to teach students the current wireless and mobile communication technologies, and to let them gain hands-on experiences with the application of wireless technologies. Thus, we proposed a new course to introduce wireless communication and wireless networks in 2006. The new course has been strongly supported by local industry as well as the department's industrial advisor committee. The new course has been offered twice in 2006 and received very positive student responses.

Pain Management: Regional Anesthesia: Avoid using regional anesthesia techniques, such as paravertebral anesthesia, as they may increase the risk of cancer recurrence and metastasis by exacerbating the surgical stress response and increasing opioid use [5, 6].\n #Reference: [5]: BACKGROUND: Regional anesthesia is known to prevent or attenuate the surgical stress response; therefore, inhibiting surgical stress by paravertebral anesthesia might attenuate perioperative factors that enhance tumor growth and spread. The authors hypothesized that breast cancer patients undergoing surgery with paravertebral anesthesia and analgesia combined with general anesthesia have a lower incidence of cancer recurrence or metastases than patients undergoing surgery with general anesthesia and patient-controlled morphine analgesia. METHODS: In this retrospective study, the authors examined the medical records of 129 consecutive patients undergoing mastectomy and axillary clearance for breast cancer between September 2001 and December 2002. RESULTS: Fifty patients had surgery with paravertebral anesthesia and analgesia combined with general anesthesia, and 79 patients had general anesthesia combined with postoperative morphine analgesia. The follow-up time was 32 \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b1 5 months (mean \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b1 SD).

However, anesthetic management and narcotic substance use may have significant impacts on patients with lung cancer, including anti-cancer or promoting cancer effects. In this study, we summarize the effects of anesthetic management and its related substances on lung cancer. An evidence-based review of the influence of anesthetic techniques and narcotic substances used on lung cancer was performed. The effects of perioperative pain management and the method of choosing anesthesia for patients with lung cancer were explored. Different management techniques of anesthesia have been indicated to suppress both cell-mediated immunity and humoral immunity and have effects on the recurrence and metastasis of lung cancer. Evidence suggests that the effects of narcotic substances used on lung cancer were still inconsistent. However, the mechanisms by which anesthetics and analgesics inhibit the tumor are complicated. Perioperative management leads to decreased immunity in patients with lung cancer, which to some extent contributes to recurrence and metastasis. Various narcotic substances used may modulate signal pathways, including the mitochondrial pathway, and appear to exert different effects on the recurrence and metastasis of lung cancer. The anesthesiologists should consider these effects on perioperative management with lung cancer.",

The Clinical Practice Committee of the Scandinavian Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine appointed a working group to develop guidelines based on literature searches to assess evidence, and a consensus meeting was held. Consensus opinion was used in the many topics where high-grade evidence was unavailable. The recommendations include the following: anaesthesia for emergency patients should be given by, or under very close supervision by, experienced anaesthesiologists. Problems with the airway and the circulation must be anticipated. The risk of aspiration must be judged for each patient. Pre-operative gastric emptying is rarely indicated. For pre-oxygenation, either tidal volume breathing for 3 min or eight deep breaths over 60 s and oxygen flow 10 l/min should be used. Pre-oxygenation in the obese patients should be performed in the head-up position. The use of cricoid pressure is not considered mandatory, but can be used on individual judgement. The hypnotic drug has a minor influence on intubation conditions, and should be chosen on other grounds. Ketamine should be considered in haemodynamically compromised patients. Opioids may be used to reduce the stress response following intubation. For optimal intubation conditions, succinylcholine 1-1.5 mg/kg is preferred.

Studies have shown that women who engage in regular physical activity during pregnancy do not experience better physical fitness, which can negatively impact labor and delivery outcomes [1, 2].\n #Reference: [1]: Background: Physiological responses of the fetus (especially increase in heart rate) to single, brief bouts of maternal exercise have been documented frequently.Many pregnant women wish to engage in aerobic exercise during pregnancy but are concerned about possible adverse effects on the outcome of pregnancy. Objectives: The objective of this review was to assess the effects of advising healthy pregnant women to engage in regular aerobic exercise (at least two to three times per week), or to increase or reduce the intensity, duration, or frequency of such exercise, on physical fitness, the course of labour and delivery, and the outcome of pregnancy. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (June 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to 2005 January Week 1), EMBASE (1980 to 2005 January Week 1), Conference Papers Index (earliest to 2005 January Week 1), contacted researchers in the field and searched reference lists of retrieved articles. We updated the search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register on 31 July 2009 and added the results to the awaiting classification section of the review. Selection criteria: Acceptably controlled trials of prescribed exercise programs in healthy pregnant women. Data collection and analysis: Both review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Main results: Eleven trials involving 472 women were included. The trials were small and not of high methodologic quality. Five trials reported significant improvement in physical fitness in the exercise group, although inconsistencies in summary statistics and measures used to assess fitness prevented quantitative pooling of results. Seven trials reported on pregnancy outcomes. A pooled increased risk of preterm birth (relative risk 1.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35 to 9.57) with exercise, albeit statistically nonsignificant, does not cohere with the absence of effect on mean gestational age (weighted mean difference +0.3, 95% CI -0.2 to +0.9 weeks), while the results bearing on growth of the fetus are inconsistent. One small trial reported that physically fit women who increased the duration of exercise bouts in early pregnancy and then reduced that duration in later pregnancy gave birth to larger infants with larger placentas. Authors' conclusions: Regular aerobic exercise during pregnancy appears to improve (or maintain) physical fitness. Available data are insufficient to infer important risks or benefits for the mother or infant. Larger and better trials are needed before confident recommendations can be made about the benefits and risk of aerobic exercise in pregnancy.

Results: There were no differences between the exercise and control groups in induction of labour, use of analgesia, duration of active labour or prolonged labour, according to ITT. Per protocol analyses, showed a shorter duration of total active labour in the exercise group (6.8 \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b1 5.5 h) than the control group (9.8 \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b1 5.4 h), with a mean between group difference of 3.1 h (95% CI 0.31\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c5.9, p = 0.029). Rate of normal vaginal delivery was 85.7% among adherent participants and 62.3% in the control group (p = 0.051). Conclusions: Regular exercise during pregnancy decreased duration of total active labour and showed a trend towards more normal vaginal deliveries among participants who adhered to the prescribed program.

It may lead to complications during pregnancy and negatively affect fetal development [7, 8].\n #Reference: [7]: Although there is no consensus as to whether exercise is beneficial during pregnancy, most studies report it poses no risk to either the mother or the fetus, and many suggest it to be beneficial to both. This review, which examines the evidence available, also reveals the many differences in study design followed, the type of exercise undertaken and the variables measured, which make it difficult to compare results. Advances in our understanding of the effects of exercise during pregnancy might best be made by undertaking randomised clinical trials with standardised protocols. However, most of the studies examining the relationship between exercise and pregnancy report no complications on maternal or fetal well-being. This is also in line with recent review studies advising that the pregnant population without obstetric contraindications should be encouraged to exercise during pregnancy. Therefore, the results of the present review stimulate those responsible for the healthcare of the pregnant woman to recommend moderate exercise throughout pregnancy without risk to maternal and fetal health.\n[8]: Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a supervised physical exercise program on fetal well-being and intrauterine safety. Physical activity is recommended for healthy pregnant women. However, constant evaluation of fetal condition and development is recommended to ensure the safety of the exercise program. Material and methods: Randomized control trial study design. Sixty-six healthy pregnant women (age 24\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c35) with singleton gestation were randomly assigned to either an exercise group (EG, n = 34) or a non-active control group (CG, n = 32). The exercise program included 81 sessions (moderate intensity, 3 times per week, 50\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c60 min/session from weeks 13 to weeks 40/41 of pregnancy). Fetal well-being was assessed in weeks 32 and 37 of pregnancy. The cerebroplacental ratio (CPR) was calculated to evaluate the safety of the exercise program for the fetus. Results: The differences in the CPR ratio measurements between EG and CG groups in week 37 (p < 0.05) were observed. The increase in the CPR ratio was also shown in week 37 of pregnancy in comparison to week 32 (p < 0.01). Moreover, maternal heart rate was significantly lower in the exercise group as measured at 37 weeks (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The results of this study confirm that regular and supervised exercise program throughout pregnancy does not affect fetal well-being and is safe for the fetus. Additionally, regular physical activity improves maternal physical fitness and cardiac efficiency which might aid at preparing pregnant women for natural labor.",

The respiratory system consists of eight main anatomical organs, including the nasal cavity, the oral cavity, the pharynx, the epiglottis, the larynx, the trachea, the bronchi, and the lungs. The trachea, more commonly referred to as the windpipe, is in the upper portion of the respiratory tract and has multiple functions, such as filtering, warming, and humidifying the air prior to it reaching the lungs. The trachea starts below the larynx and extends behind the breastbone before splitting into two smaller branches, the primary bronchi, with a similar composition that further branch into the lungs. Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine have proposed promising treatment strategies for the regeneration of damaged and disfunctioned trachea. Among different biomaterials, nanoengineered biomaterials have recently offered unique improved treatment opportunities.\n[2]: The human respiratory system consists of the upper and the lower respiratory tracts. Anatomically, the lower respiratory tract consists of the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles (terminal bronchioles and respiratory bronchioles), alveolar duct, alveolar duct sacs, and alveoli.

        "input": "#Claim: Key Points: Function of RBCs: The primary function of RBCs is to carry oxygen via hemoglobin, a protein that binds oxygen molecules. RBCs are highly deformable, allowing them to navigate through narrow capillaries to deliver oxygen efficiently [1, 2, 4, 5].\n #Reference: [1]: In blood, the primary role of red blood cells (RBCs) is to transport oxygen via highly regulated mechanisms involving hemoglobin (Hb). Hb is a tetrameric porphyrin protein comprising of two \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b1- A nd two \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b2-polypeptide chains, each containing an iron-containing heme group capable of binding one oxygen molecule. In military as well as civilian traumatic exsanguinating hemorrhage, rapid loss of RBCs can lead to suboptimal tissue oxygenation and subsequent morbidity and mortality. In such cases, transfusion of whole blood or RBCs can significantly improve survival. However, blood products including RBCs present issues of limited availability and portability, need for type matching, pathogenic contamination risks, and short shelf-life, causing substantial logistical barriers to their prehospital use in austere battlefield and remote civilian conditions. While robust research is being directed to resolve these issues, parallel research efforts have emerged toward bioengineering of semisynthetic and synthetic surrogates of RBCs, using various cross-linked, polymeric, and encapsulated forms of Hb. These Hb-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) can potentially provide therapeutic oxygenation when blood or RBCs are not available. Several of these HBOCs have undergone rigorous preclinical and clinical evaluation, but have not yet received clinical approval in the USA for human use. While these designs are being optimized for clinical translations, several new HBOC designs and molecules have been reported in recent years, with unique properties. The current article will provide a comprehensive review of such HBOC designs, including current state-of-the-art and novel molecules in development, along with a critical discussion of successes and challenges in this field.\n[2]: This chapter will address the special properties of the red blood cells in promoting oxygen carriage, the methods of safe blood and blood component transfusion and consideration of the hazards of these procedures. THE PHYSIOLOGY OF BLOOD The vascular system and the blood which flows within it can be regarded as the communication and nutrient highway of the body. Blood consists of a fluid phase, plasma, and cells of the haematopoietic system (e.g. red blood cells, leucocytes and their precursors). Plasma contains numerous elements, chemical messengers and protective proteins, including coagulation factors. The cellular part of the blood consists of red blood cells, which are discussed in more detail below, platelets, which are essential for normal haemostasis, and white blood cells, which are the travelling immune system responsible for host defence. RED BLOOD CELLS Haemoglobin is packaged into red blood cells, which normally have a lifespan of 120 days. During this time they probably travel about 300 miles and must be sufficiently deformable to pass repeatedly through the microcirculation where the vessels are less than half the red cell diameter. The special properties of the red cell skeleton (forming a biconcave disc) and metabolic pathways are crucial to these features and any disturbance of these, such as inherited or acquired structural abnormalities (e.g. spherocytosis) or enzyme defects, is likely to adversely affect function and therefore oxygen carrying capacity. One of the key functions of blood is the transport of oxygen (mainly by the haemoglobin in the red cells) to the tissues and removal of carbon dioxide from them. Red blood cells are produced in the bone marrow, originating from pluripotent stem cells, and are released in a carefully controlled manner so that the production of new red cells (about 2 X 1011 per day) balances the rate of destruction. The rate of production can be increased considerably (up to about eight times the normal rate) and occurs when demand is increased as a consequence of anoxia, haemorrhage, haemolysis or at increased altitudes. Red cell production is controlled by many factors such as the supply of essential constituents and cofactors (including iron, B12 and folate), specific hormones and cytokines, erythropoietin in particular, and others such as growth hormone, thyroxin, corticosteroids and androgens. Erythropoietin is produced mainly in the kidneys, with some produced in the liver, and it enhances red cell production in response to tissue anoxia.\n[4]: Blood is a specialised fluid composed of blood cells suspended in a liquid called the plasma. It is responsible for transporting nutrients, chemical signals, metabolic waste and heat around the body. The blood cells are mainly red blood cells (also called RBCs or erythrocytes) and white blood cells, including leukocytes and platelets. RBCs are linked to many diseases such an sickle cell anemia and malaria infection. As Red blood cells (RBCs) are required to flow through thin capillaries to deliver oxygen to the tissues that make up the human body, deformability is crucial when studying micro-circulation. Using images acquired from a micro-channel with a contraction, where the cells experience extensionally- dominated flow near the centreline, we track RBCs throughout the sequence and analyse its deformation at different time frames. Studying RBCs behaviourin blood vessels can tell us much about the normal or diseased state of these cells. Furthermore, modelling issues related to rheology can be addressed. The results show the extremely deformable behaviour of RBCs under strong extensional flows.\n[5]: The capillaries, with diameters typically in the range of 4 to 8 \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00bcm, are the terminal branches of the circulatory system. Blood is a concentrated suspension, containing 40-45 per cent volume of red blood cells (erythrocytes) suspended in plasma. These cells must undergo large deformations while passing through capillaries. Even so, the resistance to blood flow measured in capillary-sized glass tubes is less than would be expected based on the viscosity of blood measured in bulk. Theoretical analyses, in which the red blood cell is modelled as an elastic axisymmetric shell and lubrication theory is used to analyse the motion of plasma around the cell, provide a quantitative explanation for this behaviour. The walls of capillaries in vivo have been found to be lined with an endothelial surface layer of macromolecules with thickness of the order 1 \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00bcm. This layer interacts mechanically with moving red blood cells, and may protect them from damage as they traverse the irregularities of the microcirculation numerous times during the typical 120-days lifetime of each red blood cell. \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a9 IMechE 2006.",

Patients and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with injuries that were primarily caused by yoga. Patients were seen from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2018. Injuries were categorized into 3 groups: (1) soft tissue injury, (2) axial nonbony injury, and (3) bony injury. Patients underwent evaluation and were counseled to modify exercise activity. Results: We identified 89 patients for inclusion in the study. Within the soft tissue group, 66 patients (74.2%) had mechanical myofascial pain due to overuse. Rotator cuff injury was seen in 6 (6.7%), and trochanteric bursopathy was observed in 1 (1.1%). In the axial group, exacerbation of pain in degenerative joint disease (46 patients [51.7%]) and facet arthropathy (n=34 [38.2%]) were observed. Radiculopathy was seen in 5 patients (5.6%). Within the bony injury category, kyphoscoliosis was seen on imaging in 15 patients (16.9%). Spondylolisthesis was present in 15 patients (16.9%).

In Japan, yoga is practiced widely to promote health, but yoga-associated adverse events have also been reported. To date, the frequencies and characteristics of yoga-related adverse events have not been elucidated. This study was conducted to elucidate the frequencies and characteristics of adverse events of yoga performed in classes and the risk factors of such events. Methods: The subjects were 2508 people taking yoga classes and 271 yoga therapists conducting the classes. A survey for yoga class attendees was performed on adverse events that occurred during a yoga class on the survey day. A survey for yoga therapists was performed on adverse events that the therapists had observed in their students to date. Adverse events were defined as undesirable symptoms or responses that occurred during a yoga class. Results: Among 2508 yoga class attendees, 1343 (53.5%) had chronic diseases and 1063 (42.3%) were receiving medication at hospitals. There were 687 class attendees (27.8%) who reported some type of undesirable symptoms after taking a yoga class. Musculoskeletal symptoms such as myalgia were the most common symptoms, involving 297 cases, followed by neurological symptoms and respiratory symptoms. Most adverse events (63.8%) were mild and did not interfere with class participation. The risk factors for adverse events were examined, and the odds ratios for adverse events were significantly higher in attendees with chronic disease, poor physical condition on the survey day, or a feeling that the class was physically and mentally stressful. In particular, the occurrence of severe adverse events that interfered with subsequent yoga practice was high among elderly participants (70 years or older) and those with chronic musculoskeletal diseases. Conclusions: The results of this large-scale survey demonstrated that approximately 30% of yoga class attendees had experienced some type of adverse event. Although the majority had mild symptoms, the survey results indicated that attendees with chronic diseases were more likely to experience adverse events associated with their disease. Therefore, special attention is necessary when yoga is introduced to patients with stress-related, chronic diseases.\n[2]: Objective: To analyze injuries that were directly associated with yoga practice and identify specific poses that should be avoided in patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis.

Fasting lipid profile, including triglyceride (TG) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol routinely feature in the outpatient investigation list. Utility of TG/HDL ratio as a surrogate marker for IR was thus studied in healthy young males. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study involved 71 young males aged 18-35 years who came for a routine health check in a fasting state. Height, weight, waist circumference were recorded. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and lipid profile reports were collected from the laboratory database. Fasting insulin (FI) was estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Body mass index (kg/m<sup>2</sup>), TG/HDL, TC/HDL, and HOMA-IR2 were calculated. Results: Mean TG/HDL ratio was 3.73 \u00c2\u00b1 2.03 and HOMA IR2 was above the standard cut off of \u00e2\u0089\u00a52.5 units. Subjects were further divided into two groups based on FPG values. TG, low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, TG/HDL, TC/HDL, FI and HOMA-IR2 were found to be higher in the pre-diabetes with impaired fasting glycemic subjects. Overall, a statistically significant positive correlation was seen (P = 0.01, r = 0.284) between TG/HDL and HOMA-IR2. Conclusion: TG/HDL ratio was significantly associated with IR and it could be used as an indicator of IR especially in prediabetic subjects having impaired fasting glucose.\n[12]: Objective: To evaluate the association between serum concentrations of complement factor-3 (C3) with anthropometric, biochemical, and lifestyle features in healthy young adults. Methods: From 157 young healthy adults 18 to 35 y old, anthropometric measurements and body composition, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and lifestyle data were collected and analyzed. Blood samples were collected after a 12-h fast for the determination of glucose, triacylglycerols, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, insulin, C3, ceruloplasmin, and uric acid. Results: Complement factor-3 correlated directly with body mass index (r = 0.23417, P = 0.0032), body fat mass (bioelectrical impedance analysis; r = 0.33407, P < 0.0001), percentage of body fat (bioelectrical impedance analysis; r = 0.26873, P = 0.0007), waist circumference (r = 0.21266, P = 0.0075), insulin (r = 0.26152, P = 0.0009), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (r = 0.24831, P = 0.0017), total cholesterol (r = 0.23335, P = 0.0033), triacylglycerols (r = 0.38435, P < 0.0001), and other outcome measurements. In the multiple linear regression analysis, triacylglycerols (r <sup>2</sup> = 0.1379, P < 0.0001) and body fat mass (bioelectrical impedance analysis; r <sup>2</sup> = 0.0621, P = 0.0010) were independently associated with the C3 concentration after adjusting for age, gender, smoking status, and physical activity. Conclusion: Complement factor-3 seems to be related to several anthropometric and biochemical measurements in healthy young adults. These results demonstrate an independent role of triacylglycerols, a component of the metabolic syndrome, and body fat mass as possible predictors of C3 concentrations. Thus, C3 can be used as an early marker for metabolic syndrome manifestations. \u00c2\u00a9 2012 Elsevier Inc..",

Among the different potential manifestations of an allergic reaction, those exclusively affecting the gastrointestinal system are described. In recent years, the study of non-IgE-mediated food allergy has grown in relevance. These disorders are almost always of a transient nature, inherent to (though not exclusive of) nursing infants, and with gastrointestinal symptoms that may have variable repercussions upon the nutritional state of the patient. The prevalence of such reactions is not known, though some studies report that up to 60 % of all cases of allergy to cow's milk proteins (CMPs) are due to non-IgE-mediated mechanisms. The latency period between the time of ingestion and the appearance of the first clinical manifestations is greater than in the case of IgE-mediated reactions, and the underlying immunopathological mechanism has not been clearly established - although it is accepted that T cell mediation is involved. The gastrointestinal problems derived from these delayed or chronic reactions comprise allergic proctocolitis, enterocolitis and food protein enteropathies. These digestive disorders tend to appear in the first months of life, and are of a progressive and generally self-limiting nature, with resolution at about two years of age. The most commonly implicated food is milk and, in our setting, there have also been reports implicating fish, egg and rice - although such reactions can be triggered by any protein introduced into the infant diet. These manifestations disappear after removing the causal protein from the diet. When the causal proteins are CMPs, a highly hydrolysed infant formula is supplied as substitute, and if the latter is not tolerated, an elemental amino acid-based formula is prescribed. \u00c2\u00a9 2009 Sociedad Espa\u00c3\u00b1ola de Inmunolog\u00c3\u00ada Cl\u00c3\u00adnica y Alergolog\u00c3\u00ada Pedi\u00c3\u00a1trica y Elsevier Espa\u00c3\u00b1a S.L.\n[2]: Food allergies are immune-mediated responses to food proteins. Because of differences in the underlying immunologic mechanisms, there are varying clinical presentations of food allergy. This article discusses the manifestations of IgE-mediated disorders, including urticaria and angioedema, rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma, gastrointestinal anaphylaxis, generalized anaphylaxis, food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis, and oral allergy syndrome. It also reviews the presentations of mixed IgE- and cell-mediated disorders, including atopic dermatitis and eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders. Finally, the manifestations of cell-mediated food allergies are discussed, including dietary protein-induced proctitis and proctocolitis, food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome, celiac disease, and food-induced pulmonary hemosiderosis. \u00c2\u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc.\n[11]: Foodstuff allergies occur in approximately 5% in children and 2% in adults. In contrast to druginduced allergic reactions, seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) or allergic bronchial asthma, the symptoms of foodstuff allergies are often uncharacteristic and the association with exposure to allergens is not immediately obvious, in particular as various organ systems can also be affected. Whereas the term gastrointestinal allergy merely describes the manifestation of an allergy in the gastrointestinal tract, the term foodstuff allergy includes not only the manifestation in the gastrointestinal tract but also further multiple manifestation sites outside the gastrointestinal tract. First of all a thorough anamnesis with an exact description of nutritional and life-style habits is necessary.

Both these interlinked chronic conditions contribute to their worst outcomes. Aims: The objective of the present study was to analyze the frequency of depression in diabetes and its correlation with demographic details like age, sex, domicile, education, income, and marital status. Settings and Design: The study was conducted in the private diabetic clinic in outer Delhi (Rohini). Subjects and Methods: Totally, 250 patients attending the outpatient department of private diabetic clinic were assessed with Beck Depression Inventory Scale which was a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory. Results: Among the study population, 11.6% of the patients had co-morbid depression with more prevalence in females when compared with males. The demographic analysis revealed that depression incidence was higher in urban population, lower socio-economic class, and in patients with diabetes more than 5 years when compared with their counterparts and similar in graduate and undergraduate student population. Interestingly, the numbers of depression cases were found only in married population contrary to none in unmarried category. Conclusion: Present study concluded that co-morbidity of depression is prevalent in diabetic population with three times higher frequency than the considered feature of mild depression.\n[6]: Comorbid medical illnesses are a key feature of geriatric mood disorders, yet the specificity of such associations remains unclear. In a sample of 546 primary care patients age \u00e2\u0089\u00a565 years, pathology in several organ systems (respiratory, eye/ear/nose/throat, gastrointestinal, central nervous system, endocrine) and several chronic conditions (neurological disease, low vision, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes) were associated with depression. However, notwithstanding these specific associations, global (overall) medical burden was most powerfully and independently associated with depression, largely independent of functional status. This generates the hypothesis that, in general primary care populations, the relationship of medical illness to depression may be multimodal and/or may involve shared pathobiological or psychosocial mechanisms.

Participants included 7,620 primary care attendees; 66% were females; age range from 18 to 76 years (mean = 51years SD = 14); 81% were born in Australia; 64% were married and 67% lived in an urban area. The main outcome measures include the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and a study-specific self-report check list of 12 common chronic physical health problems. Results The prevalence of probable depression increased with increasing number of chronic physical conditions (1 condition: 23%; 2 conditions: 27%; 3 conditions: 30%; 4 conditions: 31%; 5 or more conditions: 41%). Only 16% of those with no listed physical conditions recorded CES-D scores of 16 or above. Across the listed physical conditions the prevalence of 'probable depression' ranged from 24% for hypertension; 35% for emphysema; 35% for dermatitis to 36% for stroke. The dose-response relationship is reduced when functional limitations and self-rated health are taken into account, suggesting that these factors mediate the relationship.

The association between these conditions appeared to be in a bidirectional way, however the joint causal relationship yet to be fully understood in elderly Chinese population. Methods: A total of 4605 Chinese elders from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS, 2011\u00e2\u0080\u00932015) were included for the present study. Physical multimorbidity was defined as having two or more self-reported chronic physical conditions. Subclinical depression was defined by \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 scores assessed using the 10-item Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. The bidirectional association between physical multimorbidity and subclinical depression was examined using multivariable logistic regression models, adjusting for covariates. Results: During study period, 23.99% of participant reported incident episode of subclinical depression and 21.36% reported physical multimorbidity. In fully adjusted model, those with physical multimorbidity were two times more likely to have subclinical depression (OR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.71\u00e2\u0080\u00932.46). Besides that, subclinical depression was associated with physical multimorbidity (OR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.50\u00e2\u0080\u00932.46), but in slightly less magnitude. Furthermore, the bidirectional association remains statistically significant across different subgroups. Limitations: Chronic conditions were all self-reported and we couldn't adjust for all confounders, which may be subject to measurement error. Conclusions: Physical multimorbidity and subclinical depression was associated in a bidirectional way in elderly Chinese population, which highlights the necessary of covering a broad spectrum of aspects of clinical management among adults with physical multimorbidity or subclinical depression.",

The disorder is associated with high rates of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders and general medical illnesses, lower rates of adherence to medication regimens, and poorer outcomes for chronic physical illness. While 51.6% of cases reporting MDD received health care treatment for the illness, only 21.7% of all MDD cases received minimal guideline-level treatment. Because the overwhelming majority of patients with depressive disorders are seen annually by their primary care physicians, the opportunity to diagnose and treat patients early in the course of their illness in the primary care setting is substantial, though largely unfulfilled by our current health care system. The goal of treatment is 2-fold: early and complete remission of symptoms of depression and eventual recovery to premorbid levels of functioning in response to acute-phase treatment, and prevention of relapse during the continuation phase or recurrence during the maintenance phase. However, only 25% to 50% of patients with MDD adhere to their antidepressant regimen for the length of time recommended by depression guidelines, and nearly 50% of depressed patients referred from primary care to specialty care treatment fail to complete the referral. Patients with chronic or treatment-resistant depression often require multiple trials using an algorithm-based approach involving more than one treatment strategy. Under conditions of usual care, 40% to 44% of patients with MDD treated with antidepressants in the primary care setting show a >or=50% improvement in depression scores at 4-month follow-up, compared with 70% to 75% of those treated using collaborative care models. This demonstrates the importance of factors other than antidepressant medication per se for achieving treatment effectiveness. Additional research is needed to evaluate longer-term outcomes of algorithm-based, stepped, collaborative care models that incorporate patient self-management in conjunction with usual care. Furthermore, the health care system must undergo major transformation to effectively treat depression, along with other chronic illnesses. The use of evidence-based treatment algorithms are discussed and recommendations are provided for patients and physicians based on collaborative care interventions that may be useful for improving the current management of depressive disorders.\n[12]: BACKGROUND: As medical homes are developing under health reform, little is known regarding depression services need and use by diverse safety-net populations in under-resourced communities. For chronic conditions like depression, primary care services may face new opportunities to partner with diverse community service providers, such as those in social service and substance abuse centers, to support a collaborative care model of treating depression. OBJECTIVE: To understand the distribution of need and current burden of services for depression in under-resourced, diverse communities in Los Angeles. DESIGN: Baseline phase of a participatory trial to improve depression services with data from client screening and follow-up surveys. PARTICIPANTS: Of 4,440 clients screened from 93 programs (primary care, mental health, substance abuse, homeless, social and other community services) in 50 agencies, 1,322 were depressed according to an eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) and gave contact information; 1,246 enrolled and 981 completed surveys. Ninety-three programs, including 17 primary care/public health, 18 mental health, 20 substance abuse, ten homeless services, and 28 social/other community services, participated. MAIN MEASURES: Comparisons by setting in 6-month retrospective recall of depression services use. KEY RESULTS: Depression prevalence ranged from 51.9 % in mental health to 17.2 % in social-community programs. Depressed clients used two settings on average to receive depression services; 82 % used any setting. More clients preferred counseling over medication for depression treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Need for depression care was high, and a broad range of agencies provide depression care. Although most participants had contact with primary care, most depression services occurred outside of primary care settings, emphasizing the need to coordinate and support the quality of community-based services across diverse community settings. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Society of General Internal Medicine.",

The basic requirements for such approach include: early initiation of insulin therapy, minimizing adverse drug reactions (hypoglycaemia, weight gain, poorer quality of life) and selection of the best insulin regimen. Therapy has to achieve long-term satisfactory diabetes control to prevent chronic vascular complications.

It has been confirmed that insulin therapy improves secretory function of \u00ce\u00b2-cells and insulin sensitivity. The requirement for early insulin initiation is based on the \"metabolic memory\" phenomenon; improved glycaemic compensation (even if it is followed by decompensation) has a positive effect on the risk of delayed complications.

The number of endocrinologists is grossly inadequate to provide care for all individuals with diabetes, but with the appropriate utilization of the primary care workforce and alternative healthcare providers working together in teams, effective diabetes care can be provided to all. We propose a patient-centered, goal-based approach with resources devoted to care coordination, measurement of outcomes, appropriate use of technology, and measurement of patient satisfaction. Financial incentives to healthcare systems and providers need to be based on defined outcome measures and reducing long-term total medical expenditures, rather than reimbursement based on number of visits and lengthy documentation. Endocrinologists have a responsibility in setting up effective diabetes care delivery systems within their organizations, in addition to delivering diabetes care and serving as a resource for the educational needs for other medical professionals in the community.

It is important that children are supported to optimally manage their diet, exercise, blood glucose monitoring and insulin regime at school. Young people self-manage at college/university.Method: Theory-informed mixed-method systematic review to determine intervention effectiveness and synthesise child/parent/professional views of barriers and facilitators to achieving optimal diabetes self-care and management for children and young people age 3-25 years in educational settings.Results: Eleven intervention and 55 views studies were included. Meta-analysis was not possible. Study foci broadly matched school diabetes guidance. Intervention studies were limited to specific contexts with mostly high risk of bias. Views studies were mostly moderate quality with common transferrable findings.Health plans, and school nurse support (various types) were effective. Telemedicine in school was effective for individual case management. Most educational interventions to increase knowledge and confidence of children or school staff had significant short-term effects but longer follow-up is required. Children, parents and staff said they struggled with many common structural, organisational, educational and attitudinal school barriers. Aspects of school guidance had not been generally implemented (e.g. individual health plans). Children recognized and appreciated school staff who were trained and confident in supporting diabetes management.Research with college/university students was lacking. Campus-based college/university student support significantly improved knowledge, attitudes and diabetes self-care. Self-management was easier for students who juggled diabetes-management with student lifestyle, such as adopting strategies to manage alcohol consumption.Conclusion: This novel mixed-method systematic review is the first to integrate intervention effectiveness with views of children/parents/professionals mapped against school diabetes guidelines. Diabetes management could be generally improved by fully implementing and auditing guideline impact. Evidence is limited by quality and there are gaps in knowledge of what works. Telemedicine between healthcare providers and schools, and school nurse support for children is effective in specific contexts, but not all education systems employ onsite nurses.

In fact, many children demonstrate resilience regardless of the number of ACEs recorded [1, 2].\n #Reference: [1]: Aim: Vulnerable children can be defined as those at risk of child abuse and neglect and long-term adverse health, neurodevelopmental and behavioural outcomes. This study examined whether a cohort of paediatricians and advanced trainees at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, recognised children's vulnerability. Methods: We reviewed the clinical note in the electronic medical record (EMR) for 425 new patients presenting to five paediatric clinics between 1 July 2017 and 31 December 2017. We examined paediatrician documentation of adverse childhood experiences (ACE), risk and resilience factors, referrals for intervention to improve psychosocial well-being and the application of \u00e2\u0080\u0098vulnerable child\u00e2\u0080\u0099 alert flags in the EMR to indicate vulnerability to harm. Children were deemed vulnerable if the paediatrician explicitly stated it in the EMR, if the child had a \u00e2\u0080\u0098vulnerable child\u00e2\u0080\u0099 alert placed in their record or had an appropriate referral for management of neurodevelopmental trauma. Results: Of the original cohort, 8% was documented as vulnerable, 21% had a referral for intervention and 2% had a \u00e2\u0080\u0098vulnerable child\u00e2\u0080\u0099 alert. Overall, paediatricians infrequently documented ACE, risk and protective factors. The odds of identifying vulnerability increased with each added risk factor recorded (odds ratio (OR) 2.6, P < 0.001, 95% confidence interval (1.9\u00e2\u0080\u00933.5)), with an ACE score was >4 (OR 72, P < 0.001 (14.3\u00e2\u0080\u0093361)) and decreased with each added protective factor recorded (OR 0.6, P < 0.001 (0.5\u00e2\u0080\u00930.8)). Conclusion: Paediatricians infrequently document ACE, risk and protective factors and rarely \u00e2\u0080\u0098flag\u00e2\u0080\u0099 children's vulnerability to harm. Identification of the vulnerable child is correlated with documentation of risk and resilience factors at the initial consultation.\n[2]: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are stressful or traumatic events that children experience before age 18 years. Studies have linked exposure to ACEs and negative health, and developmental and behavioral outcomes. Screening in pediatric medical settings provides a clear opportunity for early detection, intervention, and treatment. Providing anticipatory guidance on healthy relationships, sleep, exercise, nutrition, mindfulness, and nature is essential. Pediatric medical providers must screen and intervene. Primary care is the ideal setting for ACE screening because interacting with children and their families at regular intervals can allow patients and providers to develop a trusting relationship.",

The author describes basic behavioral risks for young people's health and a role played by the closest social environment in minimizing or aggravating them. The author also provides an insight into concepts of health and healthy lifestyle and dwells on how important it is to perform constant monitoring over children's and teenagers' health as they represent quite a specific social and demographic group. The author analyzes data on morbidity growth among children and teenagers in Russia, how susceptible they are to addictive behavior and other risk factors, and also compares these parameters with world trends. The latest statistical data and analysis of data available from literature allowed showing that, in spite of huge socializing potential that a family has as a social institution, at present parents are rather limited in terms of activities that can help them improve and preserve their children's health. It is caused by both transformations of a family as a social institution and weaker family relations in the contemporary world as well as by insufficient competences that parents have as regards health and overall decrease in living standards, poorer availability of medical services, unfavorable changes in the ecological situation etc. The author concludes that it is necessary to provide support to a family as a social institution. It should be done by a state and society in general as they are to establish qualitative information channels that will allow providing parents with the latest scientific data on the most common risk factors for children's health and on ways how to minimize such risks.

Methods: Children aged 8\u00e2\u0080\u009312\u00c2\u00a0years with myopia received baseline measurements and were instructed to wear their glasses every day and return for a follow-up visit after one year. Axial length and other ocular parameters were measured using a noncontact biometer. The contour of the posterior eye was calculated and analysed based on images from spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Univariate and multivariate linear regression models were created to analyse the relationship between the contour of the posterior eye and the progression of myopia. Results: Baseline posterior ocular contour measurements correlated with baseline axial length and spherical equivalent refraction (SER) (all p\u00c2\u00a0<\u00c2\u00a00.05). Eyes that were more myopic tended to have a more prolate posterior ocular contour. Although the baseline contour of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and chorioscleral interface (CSI) showed no significant relationship with the progression of myopia (all p\u00c2\u00a0>\u00c2\u00a00.05), interestingly, when the baseline contour of the RPE was more prolate than that of the CSI, the axial length increased during the following year (R<sup>2</sup>\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a00.62; p\u00c2\u00a0<\u00c2\u00a00.01). The multivariate model, when adjusted for other variables, further validated the independent role of this variable. Conclusions: The difference between the RPE and CSI contours correlated with the subsequent progression of myopia in children. This finding can help inform clinicians regarding the management of children at the onset of myopia and potentially provide an avenue for experimental research on the mechanism of myopia development. [13] Peripheral refraction, the refractive error present outside the main direction of gaze, has lately attracted interest due to its alleged relationship with the progression of myopia. The ray tracing procedures involved in its calculation need to follow an approach different from those used in conventional ophthalmic lens design, where refractive errors are compensated only in the main direction of gaze. We present a methodology for the evaluation of the peripheral refractive error in ophthalmic lenses, adapting the conventional generalized ray tracing approach to the requirements of the evaluation of peripheral refraction. The nodal point of the eye and a retinal conjugate surface will be used to evaluate the three-dimensional distribution of refractive error around the fovea. The proposed approach enables us to calculate the three-dimensional peripheral refraction induced by any ophthalmic lens at any direction of gaze and to personalize the lens design to the requirements of the user. The complete evaluation process for a given user prescribed with a-5.76D ophthalmic lens for foveal vision is detailed, and comparative results obtained when the geometry of the lens is modified and when the central refractive error is over-or undercorrected. The methodology is also applied for an emmetropic eye to show its application for refractive errors other than myopia.",

Clinical Relevance In the United States, myopia affects approximately 34 million people (2010), and similar figures have been reported in Europe. Pathologic myopia (PM), a possible consequence of myopia, is estimated to affect up to 3% of the global population. One of the most serious complications of PM is myopic CNV, which often leads to a sudden onset but progressive decline in central vision and is associated with a poor prognosis unless treated. Furthermore, 35% of patients with myopic CNV develop bilateral disease in the fellow eye within 8 years. Although intravitreal anti\u00e2\u0080\u0093vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies have had a major impact on the management of patients with myopic CNV, there remain significant gaps in our understanding of this condition and how to best administer treatment. Additionally, the long-term safety and efficacy of these treatments are largely unknown. Methods We carried out a literature review (September 2015) of all English-language articles in PubMed resulting from searches of the following terms: \u00e2\u0080\u009cchoroidal neovascularization\u00e2\u0080\u009d AND \u00e2\u0080\u009cmyopia\u00e2\u0080\u009d OR \u00e2\u0080\u009cmyopic macular degeneration\u00e2\u0080\u009d OR \u00e2\u0080\u009cdegenerative myopia\u00e2\u0080\u009d OR \u00e2\u0080\u009cmyopic maculopathy\u00e2\u0080\u009d OR \u00e2\u0080\u009cmyopic retinopathy\u00e2\u0080\u009d OR \u00e2\u0080\u009cpathological myopia\u00e2\u0080\u009d OR \u00e2\u0080\u009cpathologic myopia.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Results We screened a total of 566 abstracts, and 250 articles were deemed relevant for full publication review. We excluded a further 71, but an additional 44 articles were identified. This resulted in 223 articles being used to develop this review. Conclusions Highly myopic patients experiencing a sudden loss of central vision should be referred for further examination. Once a diagnosis of myopic CNV has been confirmed, after fluorescein angiography, treatment initiation should be prompt and anti-VEGF agents considered as first-line therapy, unless contraindicated. Continued monitoring of patients is required to assess any progression or recurrence of the condition.",

However, the abstracts do not provide conclusive evidence on whether undercorrection or avoiding glasses altogether leads to increased myopia progression [2].\n #Reference: [2]: Myopia is the commonest ocular abnormality and the high and growing prevalence of myopia, especially but not only in Asian populations, as well as its progressive nature in children, has contributed to a recent surge in interest. Such worldwide growing prevalence seems to be associated with increasing educational pressures, combined with lifestyle changes, which have reduced the time that children spend outdoors. Highly nearsighted people are at greater risk for several vision-threatening problems such as retinal detachments, choroidal neovascularization, cataracts and glaucoma, thus the potential benefits of interventions that can limit or prevent myopia progression would be of remarkable social impact. Our understanding of the regulatory processes that lead an eye to refractive errors is undoubtedly incomplete but has grown enormously in the last decades thanks to the animal studies, observational clinical studies, and randomized clinical trials recently published. In this review we assess the effects of several types of life-style and interventions, including outdoor activities, eye drops, undercorrection of myopia, multifocal spectacles, contact lenses, and refractive surgery on the onset and progression of nearsightedness. \u00c2\u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media 2013.",

For example, in a network meta-analysis, semaglutide was ranked among the top GLP-1 RAs for weight loss efficacy [1, 2].\n #Reference: [1]: To evaluate the effectiveness of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on weight reduction in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (Type 2 DM), a network meta-analysis was conducted. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from 1950 to October 2013. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving GLP-1 RAs were included if they provided information on body weight. A total of 51 RCTs were included and 17521 participants were enrolled. The mean duration of 51 RCTs was 31 weeks. Exenatide 10 g twice daily (EX10BID) reduced weight compared with exenatide 5 g twice daily (EX5BID), liraglutide 0.6 mg once daily (LIR0.6QD), liraglutide - 1.2 mg once daily (LIR1.2QD), and placebo treatment, with mean differences of -1.07 kg (95% CI: -2.41, -0.02), -2.38 kg (95% CI: -3.71, -1.06), -1.62 kg (95% CI: -2.79, -0.43), and -1.92 kg (95% CI: -2.61, -1.24), respectively. Reductions of weight treated with liraglutide - 1.8 mg once daily (LIR1.8QD) reach statistical significance (-1.43 kg (95% CI: -2.73, -0.15)) versus LIR1.2QD and (-0.98 kg (95% CI: -1.94, -0.02)) versus placebo. Network meta-analysis found that EX10BID, LIR1.8QD, and EX2QW obtained a higher proportion of patients with weight loss than other traditional hypoglycemic agents. Our results suggest GLP-1 RAs are promising candidates for weight control in comparison with traditional hypoglycemic drugs, and EX10BID, LIR1.8QD, and EX2QW rank the top three drugs.\n[2]: Aims: To inform clinical practice by comparing and ranking the lowing blood glucose and weight-loss abilities of 8 glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL from database inception to April 13, 2021. The outcomes were \u00ce\u0094 HbA<inf>1c</inf>, \u00ce\u0094 weight, adverse events [AE] withdrawals, and incidence of hypoglycemia. We estimated standardized mean differences [SMD] and summary odds ratios (ORs) using frequentist network meta-analysis with random effects. Results: Retrieved trials included 11,126 patients, the overall mean age was 56.7 \u00c2\u00b1 10.36 years old. In terms of efficacy, all GLP-1RAs were more effective than the placebo except albiglutide-30 mg QW (\u00ce\u0094 weight: SMD \u00e2\u0088\u00920.26 kg [95 %CI: \u00e2\u0088\u00921.10, 0.59 kg). When it came to safety, oral semaglutide-14mgQD, semaglutide-1mgQW, Liraglutide-1.8mgQD, and Exenatide-2ugBID were associated with an increased risk of AE withdrawals. And GLP-1RAs were associated with a higher incidence of hypoglycemia than placebo except albiglutide-30mgQW and orally administered semaglutide-14mgQD. Conclusion: Overall GLP-1RAs were more efficacious than placebo in patients with T2D on efficacy. Unfortunately, differences between GLP1-RAs regarding safety were mostly not significant. We may realize the individualized GLP-1RAs administration based on blood glucose level and obesity degree.",

Methods and Study Design: The study was conducted in the Padang township inhabited mostly by the Minangkabau tribe. Accordingly, 74 WoRA with dyslipidemia completed the study. Two replicate 24-h recalls and a 5-day food record were used to assess food consumption patterns. Then, linear programming (LP) analysis using three modules of the WHO Optifood software was employed to identify problem nutrients and develop FBRs. Results: Median (5th and 95th percentiles) weekly consumption frequencies for grain; meat, fish, and eggs; and added fat were 18 (14\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c27), 11 (6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c16), and 15 (7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c30), while those for fruits and vegetables were 2 (0\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c11) and 7 (2\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c16), respectively. Based on the aforementioned food pattern, PUFA (both n-3 and n-6 fatty acids), dietary fiber, iron, and zinc were identified as typical problem nutrients. The final FBR emphasized on incorporating locally available nutrient-dense foods, as well as food groups and sub-groups, which would improve the intake of problem nutrients. Conclusions: Minangkabau WoRA have dietary practices that predispose them to dyslipidemia. Moreover, the LP approach is a sensitive tool for identifying nutrient-dense foods that could potentially improve problem nutrient intake, as well as those that need to be limited in the final FBR.",

Food-based approaches have been advocated as the best strategies to curb hunger and malnutrition in developing countries. The use of low-cost, locally available, nutritious foods in the development of supplementary foods has been recommended. Objective. To develop low-cost food supplements using different traditionally processed local foods, consisting of cereals, legumes, nuts, fish, and vegetables, to meet the nutrient requirements for vulnerable groups in Kenya. Methods. Four food supplements were developed and evaluated by taste panel procedures. The product containing amaranth grain, pigeon pea, sweet potato, groundnuts, and brown sugar was found to be the most acceptable supplement. Evaluation of nutritional composition, shelf-life, and cost analysis of the acceptable supplement was carried out to assess if it could satisfactorily provide more than 50% of the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) of the basic nutrients for vulnerable groups. Results. The acceptable supplement contained 453.2 kcal energy, 12.7 g crude protein, 54.3 g soluble carbohydrates, 20.8 g crude fat, and 10.1 g crude fiber per 110 g. The micronutrient contents were 93.0 mg calcium, 172.4 mg magnesium, 2.7 mg zinc, 5.7 mg iron, 0.8 mg vitamin B1, 0.2 mg vitamin B2, 7.9 mg niacin, 100 \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00bcg folic acid, and 140 \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00bcg retinol equivalent per 110 g. The supplement also contained 21% total essential amino acid in addition to appreciable levels of palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, and ?-linolenic fatty acids. The shelf-life study showed that it could be stored in different packaging materials (polythene bags, gunny bags, and kraft paper) at 26\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C without deleterious effects on its chemical composition for up to 4 months.

Knowledge remains limited about habitual dairy consumption and the pathways to cardiometabolic risk. Objective: We aimed to investigate associations of habitual consumption of total and types of dairy products with markers of metabolic risk and adiposity among adults in the United Kingdom. Methods: We examined associations of changes in dairy consumption (assessed with a food-frequency questionnaire) with parallel changes in cardiometabolic markers using multiple linear regression among 15,612 adults aged 40-78 y at baseline (1993-1997) and followed up over 1998-2000 (mean \u00c2\u00b1 SD: 3.7\u00c2\u00b10.7 y) in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Norfolk study. Results: For adiposity, an increase in fermented dairy products [yogurt (total or low-fat) or low-fat cheese] consumption was associated with a lower increase in body weight and body mass index (BMI). For example, over 3.7 y, increasing yogurt consumption by 1 serving/d was associated with a smaller increase in body weight by 0.23 kg (95% CI:-0.46,-0.01 kg). An increase in full-fat milk, high-fat cheese, and total high-fat dairy was associated with greater increases in body weight and BMI [e.g., for high-fat dairy: \u00ce\u00b2 = 0.13 (0.05, 0.21) kg and 0.04 (0.01, 0.07) kg/m2, respectively]. For lipids, an increase in milk (total and low-fat) or yogurt consumption was positively associated with HDL cholesterol. An increase in total low-fat dairy was negatively associated with LDL cholesterol (-0.03 mmol/L;-0.05,-0.01 mmol/L), whereas high-fat dairy (total, butter, and high-fat cheese) consumption was positively associated [e.g., 0.04 (0.02, 0.06) mmol/L for total high-fat dairy]. For glycemia, increasing full-fat milk consumption was associated with a higher increase in glycated hemoglobin (P = 0.027).

The aim of the present study was thus to clarify the link between dairy consumption in relation to changes in anthropometric measures/adiposity by a meta-analytical approach. Methods For the meta-analysis PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Sciences, and google scholar were searched by two independent authors up to May 2016 with no restriction to language or calendar date. Prospective cohort studies reporting about intake of dairy consumption (including milk, yogurt, cheese, butter) and changes in body weight or waist circumference, risk of overweight, obesity, or weight gain were eligible. Pooled effects were calculated using a random effects model, and also a fixed effect model for sensitivity analysis. Due to the heterogeneity of statistical analytical approaches of the studies the analysis were done separately for beta-coefficients of changes in body weight and/or waist circumference per serving of dairy, for differences in weight gain/gain in waist circumference when comparing extreme categories of dairy consumption, and for odds ratios in regard to weight gain, overweight/obesity, or abdominal obesity. Findings 24 studies (27 reports) met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review, and 22 studies provided sufficient data for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis of the five studies on changes in body weight per serving of dairy no significant results could be found for whole fat dairy and low fat dairy. However, there was inverse association between changes in body weight for each serving's increase of yogurt (beta: -40.99 gram/year, 95% CI, -48.09 to -33.88), whereas each serving's increase of cheese was positively associated (beta: -10.97 gram/year, 95% CI, 2.86 to 19.07). Furthermore, the highest dairy intake category was associated with a reduced risk of abdominal obesity (OR: 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.95), and risk of overweight (OR: 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.00) compared to the lowest intake category. No significant association could be observed for risk of weight gain. Conclusion In summary the results of the meta-analysis still reflect that dairy consumption was not positively related to changes in body weight. Yogurt was the only dairy food that showed some evidence for a beneficial effect, where higher intakes were inversely associated a reduced risk of obesity, changes in body weight or waist circumference. Further research is needed, since the overall interpretation of the results is limited by heterogeneous risk estimates.",

Objectives To explore factors associated with caregiver involvement in various aspects of older adults' medication management (i.e., ordering, keeping track or ensuring the correct medication is taken at the correct time, and injecting medications). Methods A retrospective analysis of two national surveys, the 2011 National Health and Aging Trends Study and the National Study of Caregiving was performed. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the associations between demographic and caregiving variables with caregiver involvement in three medication management activities. Results Approximately two-thirds of family caregivers (N = 1369) were involved in one or more medication management activities. Factors associated with caregivers' assistance with ordering medications included being female, high frequency of involvement in instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), involvement in medically-related activities, and caring for an older, less educated, or Hispanic care-recipient and individuals with lung disease or dementia (p < 0.05). Caregiver living arrangement, high frequency of involvement in activities of daily living (ADLs) and IADLs, involvement in medically-related activities along with care-recipient's race/ethnicity and having a dementia diagnosis were all associated with caregiver assistance in keeping track of medications (p < 0.05). Factors associated with assistance in injecting medications were caring for older adults with diabetes or stroke, or being involved in medically-related activities (p < 0.05). Conclusions Different demographic and caregiving factors were associated with caregiver involvement in various medication management activities. Recurring factors included race/ethnicity, certain care-recipient disease states, and caregiver involvement in IADLs and medically-related activities. Healthcare providers can play a proactive role in engaging caregivers in discussion about medication management and these findings can help practitioners more effectively target caregivers for education and support. [7] As the older adult population continues to grow, the prevalence of chronic diseases is also increasing, leading to the need for novel ways of managing this large population of patients. One solution is to focus on informal caregivers. These informal caregivers already make a substantial contribution to our nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s healthcare finances and patient health outcomes. Caregivers also derive benefits from caring for their family member or friend; however, it is not uncommon for these individuals to experience negative health consequences, or what is often called \u00e2\u0080\u009cburden of care.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Those called to care are not without their own burdens, and they must frequently make significant lifestyle adjustments that impact their own health.

Calcium is necessary for bone mineralization, while vitamin D enhances calcium absorption and bone metabolism [1, 2, 3, 4].\n #Reference: [1]: A significant point of nutritional care and management for osteoporosis is that calcium and vitamin D are recommended to be actively administered on top of sufficient intake of energy and the other nutrients including protein. Daily intake of calcium and vitamin D is encouraged at least 800 mg and 10 to 20 microg, respectively. Calcium and vitamin D are also important for maximizing the effect of osteoporosis drug therapy. Supplement of calcium or vitamin D could be a supportive measure, when their necessary amount is difficult to be consumed.\n[2]: Physiological role of calcium and vitamin D in normal structure and metabolic regulation of bone tissue was presented. Calcium and vitamin D importance in their deficiencies supplementation, and in the prevention and therapy of osteoporosis was emphasized. Recommended calcium intake in different age groups and calcium content in selected salts were given.\n[3]: Vitamin D and calcium are essential for bone health. An adequate calcium-phosphorus product determines a high quality mineralization long lifetime. In older people, both calcium and Vitamin D levels may be lower causing osteomalacia and/or osteoporosis with a higher risk of fracture. Epidemiological data have clearly associated serum Vitamin D lower levels (deficiency) with bone fracture in older people, however, not univocal data exist in regard to a beneficial effect of Vitamin D supplementation in general population. Although not systematic, the present review aims to make a narrative synthesis of the most recent published data on Vitamin D effect not only on bone, classical target associated with Vitamin D studies, but namely on extraskeletal diseases. In fact, recently, there has been an increasing interest on this latter issue with surprising findings. Vitamin D, and in particular its deficiency, seems to have a role in pathophysiological pathways in several diseases involving cardiovascular, central nervous system and neoplastic process.

Up to date the data are conflicting mainly because of difficulty to establish a consensus on the threshold of Vitamin D deficit.

Effective caregiving can enhance the survivor's ability to reintegrate into the community and improve their overall QoL, and it is likely that caregivers who receive adequate support and resources may experience even greater improvements in their own well-being and caregiving effectiveness [1].\n #Reference: [1]: Background: Stroke is highly debilitating and requires long-term care. Informal caregivers of stroke survivors play important roles in stroke rehabilitation. Caring for stroke survivors can negatively affect the caregivers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 well-being and may adversely impact on their caregiving quality and subsequently on stroke survivors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 well-being. There seems to be a dearth of research on the relationships between caregivers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and stroke survivors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 well-being. Aims and Objectives: This study was designed to determine the relationships among informal caregivers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 burden and quality of life (QOL) and stroke survivors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 QOL and community reintegration. Methods: This ethically certified cross-sectional survey involved 82 stroke survivors (mean age\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a060.48\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\u00a011.13\u00c2\u00a0years) and their 82 primary caregivers (mean age\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a036.13\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\u00a013.69\u00c2\u00a0years) consecutively recruited from seven conveniently sampled tertiary hospitals in Nigeria. Caregivers Strain Index, Igbo-culture adapted Maleka Stroke Community Reintegration Measure and Short-Form 36-item Health Survey questionnaires were used to assess the caregivers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 burden, survivors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 community reintegration and QOL (of survivors and caregivers), respectively.

Stroke survivors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 QOL and community reintegration, and caregivers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 QOL and burden significantly correlated with one another (p\u00c2\u00a0<\u00c2\u00a00.05). Poststroke duration, survivor\u00e2\u0080\u0093caregiver cohabitation duration, survivors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 community-dwelling duration and daily care-giving hours significantly correlated with each of stroke survivors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 community reintegration and QOL, and caregivers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 burden and QOL (p\u00c2\u00a0<\u00c2\u00a00.05). Conclusions: Stroke survivors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 community reintegration and QOL were poor while caregivers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 had moderate QOL and high prevalence of significant burden.

The chronic nature of diabetes and its potential side effects impose high financial costs on patients and families, reduce their quality of life (QOL), and change the lifestyle of both patients and their families. Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a family-based training program on QOL in persons with Type 2 diabetes. Methods: A randomized clinical trial was used to assess the effects of an educational program on QOL both before and after 12 weeks of training for the experimental group (40 patients and families) and of standard care for the control group (40 patients) at an endocrinology clinic in a hospital in Iran. A demographic and social questionnaire and the QOL questionnaire for patients with Type 2 diabetes were used for data collection. The study groups were selected using block randomization sampling, and results were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: Both the experimental and control groups were homogeneousin terms of demographic characteristics and QOL before the intervention. The results of the mean score of patient QOL after the 12-week training program showed a significant difference between the scores for the two groups of patients in the physical, mental, social, economic, disease, and treatment dimensions. Moreover, the total score and QOL of the experimental group improved significantly after the patients' families had attended the training program. Conclusions/Implications for Practice: Educating the families of patients was shown in this study to improve the QOL of the patient. The design of educational programs for nursing students must emphasize the role of the family in the care of chronic patients.",

Methods: After IRB approval, we searched our pathology database from January 2013 to January 2017 for patients with positive pleural effusions (PEs). Patients' demographics and clinical histories were noted. Results: 474 patients were identified (288 females [61%] and 186 males [39%]), ranging in age from 19 to 64 years old. Ethnicity was distributed as follows: Caucasian (n = 330, 70%), African American (n = 114, 24%) and Asian (n = 30, 6%). The most common primary sites were the lung (n = 180, 37%), followed by the breast (n = 81, 17%), and the gynecologic system (67, 13%). The lung was the most common primary for all ethnicities (n = 190, 40%). The second-most common primary site was the breast in African Americans and Caucasians and upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract in Asians. In 5 cases (1%), the primary tumor could not be determined. Conclusion: Cytology examination is a useful method to diagnose primary sites of PE. Pulmonary primary is the most common cause of effusion in all ethnicities. In African American and Caucasian patients, the breast was the second-most common site of MPE, while in Asian patients it was the upper GI tract. [8] Rationale: Placement of an indwelling pleural catheter is an established modality for symptom relief and pleurodesis in the treatment of malignant pleural effusion. Concerns remain regarding possible infectious complications, risk of hemorrhage, and the rate of pleurodesis with the use of pleural catheters in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Objectives: The goals of our study were: (1) to evaluate the safety and cumulative incidence of pleurodesis with indwelling pleural catheters for patients with hematologic malignancies, and (2) to evaluate overall survival of this cohort of patients with pleural effusions. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of 172 patients with a hematologic malignancy who underwent placement of an indwelling pleural catheter between September 1997 and August 2011 at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. A competing risk model analysis was used for complications and pleurodesis. Analysis was based on each patient's first intrapleural catheter. Results: There were 172 patients with lymphoma (58%), acute (16%) or chronic leukemia (16%), or multiple myeloma (10%). The effusions were characterized as malignant (85.5%), infectious (4.1%), volume overload (4.7%), or therapy-related (4.7%). Chylothorax was found in 20.1%. Pleural biopsies were obtained from 13 patients. The cumulative incidence of all complications was 13.6%, and the cumulative incidence of all significant catheter-related complications was 9.5%. The incidence of empyema was 2.9%, and major bleeding (requiring transfusion or intervention) was 1.7%. Thirty-day procedure-associated mortality was 0.6%. The cumulative incidence of pleurodesis at 180 days was 50%, with amedian time to pleurodesis of 81 days for the entire cohort. Conclusions: Indwelling pleural catheters appear to be safe for patients with hematologic malignancies. Complications and the cumulative incidence of pleurodesis are comparable to those reported for patients with solid organ malignancies. [10] Introduction: malignant pleural effusion occurs as a consequence of a primary or metastatic malignant process involving the pleura. The aim of pleurodesis is to prevent re-accumulation of the effusion and avoid the need for repeated hospitalization. Povidone iodine has been used in other climes for pleurodesis with good results. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of povidone iodine in producing pleurodesis as compared to tetracycline. Methods: the study is a prospective experimental study. The patients are randomized into two groups A (tetracycline-control) and B (povidone iodine). All patients are assessed with chest X-ray after 1 week and 1 month. The responses were ascribed as complete, partial or failure. Results: thirty patients were recruited into this study, 15 patients in each group A (tetracycline) and B (povidone iodine). The mean age was 45.7\u00c2\u00b114.24 years. The commonest primary malignancy was Breast cancer (70%) followed by bronchogenic cancer (10%). Seventy three (73%) of the patients in this study had complete response and in 7% pleurodesis failed whilst 20% has partial response. In the povidone group the success rate was 93.4% and in the tetracycline group was 93.3% with a p-value of 0.716. There was no statistical difference in the responses based on the agents used. Conclusion: malignant pleural effusion is a devastating condition as it heralds the end-of-life processes of a primary malignancy. Povidone iodine is a safe, cheap, effective, widely available and effective pleurodesing agent for use in patients with malignant pleural effusion.",

Bed rest following ET has been recommended as a way to prevent embryo expulsion by gravity. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published prior to May 2014 reporting the effect of bed rest following ET, and irrespective of language, country of origin, blinding or sample size. Four RCTs, including 757 women met the inclusion criteria. Bed rest following ET did not improve clinical pregnancy and live birth rates, but reduced the implantation rate. The quality of the trials included was moderate because of attrition bias and possible reporting bias. The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis are concordant with previously published literature and suggest that bed rest is not beneficial following ET. Moreover, it might negatively affect the outcome of IVF/ICSI cycles via stress/anxiety mechanisms.",

Our comprehensive review attempts to clarify the links between the characteristics of lesions and the semiology of chronic pelvic pain symptoms. Based on randomized trials against placebo, endometriosis appears to be responsible for chronic pelvic pain symptoms in more than half of confirmed cases. A causal association between severe dysmenorrhoea and endometriosis is very probable. This association is independent of the macroscopic type of the lesions or their anatomical locations and may be related to recurrent cyclic microbleeding in the implants. Endometriosis-related adhesions may also cause severe dysmenorrhoea. There are histological and physiopathological arguments for the responsibility of deeply infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) in severe chronic pelvic pain symptoms. DIE-related pain may be in relation with compression or infiltration of nerves in the subperitoneal pelvic space by the implants. The painful symptoms caused by DIE present particular characteristics, being specific to involvement of precise anatomical locations (severe deep dyspareunia, painful defecation) or organs (functional urinary tract signs, bowel signs). They can thus be described as \"location indicating pain\".

All rights reserved.\n[4]: Purpose: Endometriosis is one of the most common benign gynecological diseases affecting women of reproductive age; it is characterized by the presence and growth of ectopic endometrial tissue outside the endometrial cavity. This complex disease is frequently associated with infertility and pelvic pain. Given the relationship and the apparent importance of the role that neurotrophins play in the reproductive system, and in particular brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which is involved in both the central and peripheral pain pathways, we were interested in determining whether the presence of endometriosis is associated and correlated with plasma and follicular fluid variation of BDNF. Methods: We determined BDNF level in plasma and in follicular fluid from infertile women with endometriosis and fertile women without the disease. Results: BDNF plasma levels were significantly higher in endometriotic patients than in control women (p<0.001). After surgery this level decreased significantly (p<0.001), ranging within the values of control women in follicular phase. In follicular fluid, BDNF values were significantly lower in infertile women for endometriosis than in infertile women for male factors (p<0.001). Conclusion: These data raise the possibility that neuroinflammatory reactions in endometriosis could have a neuroprotective effect and support the hypothesis that BDNF represents an important link in the networks of human homeostasis, thus providing an early marker for patients affected by endometriosis. Moreover, low BDNF levels in follicular fluid may reflect an altered ovary production and may be a marker of poor oocyte quality and poor fertility in women suffering from endometriosis. \u00c2\u00a9 2010 Wichtig Editore.",

Physical Exercise: Regular Physical Activity: While exercise is often mentioned as a component of stress reduction strategies, its role in consistently activating neurobiological pathways to increase mood and decrease psychological distress through the release of endogenous morphine and nitric oxide may be overstated, as not all studies support this conclusion [3].\n #Reference: [3]: Stress can facilitate disease processes and causes strain on the health care budgets. It is responsible or involved in many human ailments of our time, such as cardiovascular illnesses, particularly related to the psychosocial stressors of daily life, including work. Besides pharmacological or clinical medical treatment options, behavioral stress reduction is much-needed. These latter approaches rely on an endogenous healing potential via life-style modification. Hence, research has suggested different ways and approaches to self-treat stress or buffer against stressors and their impacts. These self-care-centred approaches are sometimes referred to as mind-body medicine or multi-factorial stress management strategies. They consist of various cognitive behavioral techniques, as well as relaxation exercises and nutritional counselling. However, a critical and consistent element of modern effective stress reduction strategies are exercise practices. With regard to underlying neurobiological mechanisms of stress relief, reward and motivation circuitries that are imbedded in the limbic regions of the brain are responsible for the autoregulatory and endogenous processing of stress. Exercise techniques clearly have an impact upon these systems. Thereby, physical activities have a potential to increase mood, i.e., decrease psychological distress by pleasure induction. For doing so, neurobiological signalling molecules such as endogenous morphine and coupled nitric oxide pathways get activated and finely tuned. Evolutionarily, the various activities and autoregulatory pathways are linked together, which can also be demonstrated by the fact that dopamine is endogenously converted into morphine which itself leads to enhanced nitric oxide release by activation of constitutive nitric oxide synthase enzymes. These molecules and mechanisms are clearly stress-reducing. Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2010 Termedia & Banach.",

One hundred and four women participated in a programme that incorporated group support, skill building and cognitive behavioural and relaxation techniques. A series of Bonferroni corrected t-tests found that the participants reported having significantly (p < 0.001) lower levels of perceived stress, improved health behaviours (sleep, nutrition, physical activity) improved overall health and improved quality of life at the end of the 12 week programme and at 1-month follow-up. Although the effect sizes for improvement were all large, there was no control group, so regression to the mean or selection bias may have impacted the results. Therefore, these results provide initial support for the implementation of gender-based worksite stress reduction programmes and provide guidance in designing an effective worksite stress reduction programme. Further research using randomized controlled trials is warranted. Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Simulation Training: Simulated Pages: Using simulated patient scenarios does not effectively prepare interns for real-life situations, often increasing stress and decreasing confidence in managing patient care [4].\n #Reference: [4]: Purpose: During the transition from medical school to internship, trainees experience high levels of stress related to pages on the inpatient wards. The steep learning curve during this period may also affect patient safety. The authors piloted the use of simulated pages to improve medical student preparedness, decrease stress related to pages, and familiarize medical students with common patient problems. Method: A multidisciplinary team at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine developed simulated pages that were tested among senior medical students. Sixteen medical students were presented with 11 common patient scenarios. Data on assessment, management, and global performance were collected. Mean confidence levels were evaluated pre- and postintervention. Students were also surveyed on how the simulated pages program influenced their perceived comfort in managing patient care needs and the usefulness of the exercise in preparing them to handle inpatient pages. Results: Mean scores on the assessment and management portions of the scenarios varied widely depending on the scenario (range -15.6 \u00c2\u00b1 41.6 to 95.7 \u00c2\u00b1 9.5). Pass rates based on global performance ranged from 12% to 93%. Interrater agreement was high (mean kappa = 0.88). Students' confidence ratings on a six-point scale increased from 1.87 preintervention to 3.53 postintervention (P < .0001). Conclusions: Simulated pages engage medical students and may foster medical student preparedness for internship. Students valued the opportunity to simulate \"on call\" responsibilities, and exposure to simulated pages significantly increased their confidence levels.

Healthcare providers play a key role in the adoption and implementation of telemedicine for its effectiveness. Despite its benefits, there have been unclear concerns about its effectiveness and acceptance in the process of implementing telemedicine. The objective of the study was to assess health professionals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 perceptions towards the implementation of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was conducted among eight hundred forty-five study participants from December 2020 to February 2021. A pre-test was performed on 5% of the total sample size, and the quality of the data was ensured by checking its completeness and consistency. Descriptive statistics and bivariable and multivariable logistic regression were used. The Variables with a P-value equal to or less than 0.25 in bivariable logistic regression were entered into a multivariable logistic regression, and model fitness was assessed. Result: The study revealed\u00c2\u00a0that 60.9% of professionals had a good perception\u00c2\u00a0toward telemedicine implementation, with an 87.2%\u00c2\u00a0response rate. Health professionals with IT support staff, ICT training, who use social media platforms regularly, and availability of computer or smartphone within/outside their health facility were 4.7, 3.3, 3.7, and 13.2 times more likely to have a positive association towards telemedicine implementation respectively. Conclusion: More than half of the health professionals had a good perception\u00c2\u00a0of telemedicine. Social media use, ICT training, computer accessibility, and the presence of IT support staff were all found to have positive associations with the telemedicine perception. In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government should take the initiative to strengthen opportunities for health professionals to learn and apply telemedicine in their medical practice by providing ICT training, IT infrastructure and support staff, improving computer access, and recommending health professionals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 positive use of social media in the health facility.\n[9]: Background: As an ever-growing popular service, telehealth catered for better access to high-quality healthcare services. It is more valuable and cost-effective, particularly in the middle of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, this study aimed to systematically review the features and challenges of telehealth-based services developed to support COVID-19 patients and healthcare providers. Methods: A comprehensive search was done for the English language and peer-reviewed articles published until November 2020 using PubMed and Scopus electronic databases. In this review paper, only studies focusing on the telehealth-based service to support COVID-19 patients and healthcare providers were included. The first author's name, publication year, country of the research, study objectives, outcomes, function type including screening, triage, prevention, diagnosis, treatment or follow-up, target population, media, communication type, guideline-based design, main findings, and challenges were extracted, classified, and tabulated. Results: Of the 5,005 studies identified initially, 64 met the eligibility criteria. The studies came from 18 countries. Most of them were conducted in the United States and China. Phone calls, mobile applications, videoconferencing or video calls, emails, websites, text messages, mixed-reality, and teleradiology software were used as the media for communication. The majority of studies used a synchronous communication. The articles addressed the prevention, screening, triage, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up aspects of COVID-19 which the most common purpose was the patients' follow-up (34/64, 53%). Thirteen group barriers were identified in the literature, which technology acceptance and user adoption, concerns about the adequacy and accuracy of subjective patient assessment, and technical issues were the most frequent ones. Conclusion: This review revealed the usefulness of telehealth-based services during the COVID-19 outbreak and beyond. The features and challenges identified through the literature can be helpful for a better understanding of current telehealth approaches and pointed out the need for clear guidelines, scientific evidence, and innovative policies to implement successful telehealth projects.",

Enhanced Connectivity and Coverage: Device-to-Device (D2D) Communication: 6G supports D2D communication, extending the coverage of medical services beyond hospitals to any location within the network, thus saving time and resources [4].\n #Reference: [4]: Due to the development of mobile transmission techniques, more exciting services can be launched that may change our daily lives in more easy and comfortable ways. The introduction of device-to-device (D2D) service in future 5G communication systems can extend the service coverage of intelligent medical treatment from hospitals to anywhere inside the network coverage area, which can save precious time and medical resources. As one of the key techniques in a 5G system, D2D technology has attracted extensive attention from academia and industry due to its system performance improvement, user experience enhancement and service extension. However, the introduction of D2D service will tremendously pollute the system transmission environment due to the induced interference, especially in the downlink direction where the interferer is very strong. This situation brings new challenges for effective and green resource utilization. To solve this problem, a green spectrum resource allocation strategy based on the Hungarian method is proposed in this paper to optimize system spectrum efficiency while considering the fairness among users under the assumption that all resources are fully shared by traditional cellular and newly introduced D2D users. To validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, a system-level Monte Carlo simulation is also conducted, which shows the favorable performance of the proposed algorithm over the traditional greedy algorithm.",

Energy Efficiency and Cost Reduction: Energy Efficiency: 5G networks are designed to be energy-efficient, which is crucial for reducing operational costs and minimizing the environmental impact of healthcare facilities [1, 11].\n #Reference: [1]: Research and development for the 5th-generation (5G) wireless systems has been initiated several years ago [1-3]. Such systems, which are set for commercial use sometime around 2020, are expected to provide new types of enhanced user connectivity services, in terms of providing very high data rates, increased capacity, improved security, higher reliability, reduced latency, increased quality of service and availability, and energy efficiency (EE). According to the 5G standard such systems should provide higher data rates, for example, tens of Mb/s and accommodating tens of thousands of users providing data rates of 100 Mb/s for metropolitan areas. Furthermore, their spectral efficiency (SE) will increase significantly, as compared to the SE achieved by the 4th-generation (4G) wireless systems, their coverage will also improve and their latency will be reduced significantly as compared to Long-Term Evolution (LTE) [2].\n[11]: For 5G and beyond 5G systems, many technologies such as Carrier Aggregation (CA) have been suggested to improve the Spectral Efficiency (SE). Along with SE, Energy Efficiency (EE) is another key parameter to be considered while designing such systems. Judiciously using available power will not only help in reducing operational costs but also make the system more environment friendly by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. From an operator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s point of view, providing better data rates to users as well as reducing operational costs is important. This paper focuses on the tradeoff between SE and EE for a system operating in the FR1 frequency band (5G) and also using CA. Detailed analysis on the effect of various parameters such as 5G NR numerology, user velocity (Doppler shift), static and signal processing power consumption of base station and power amplifier efficiency at the base station in the tradeoff between SE and EE is performed. From the simulation results, it can be observed that while varying Doppler shift has very little impact, other parameters such as numerology, static and signal processing power consumption and power amplifier efficiency greatly affect the tradeoff between SE and EE. Tradeoff improves for lower subcarrier spacing, lower static and signals processing power consumption and higher power amplifier efficiency. For simulations, a TDL-A channel model is used. A base station power consumption model which takes into account both static and signal processing power consumption and power amplifier efficiency are considered in order to provide a more practical analysis of EE.",

They are more effective in acid suppression and preventing recurrent bleeding compared to histamine 3 receptor antagonists [4, 9].\n #Reference: [4]: The bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract represent a significant medical but also socio-economic problem.A special group of patients et increased risk consists of critically ill patients in intensive care units. Particularly significant cause of bleeding in intensive care unit patients is bleeding resulting from the stress ulcers caused by damage of themucosa of the stomach and duo-denum. The purpose of this review is to present current experience in prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding using proton pump inhibitors in intensive care units. Combination of endoscopic hemostatic methods and proton pump inhibitors represents golden standard in most cases. Despite some adverse effects treatment with proton pump blockers is essential when upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding appears in critically ill patients in intensive care units. Proton pump inhibitors are more effective in acid suppression, as well as in the prevention of recurrent bleeding after endoscopic hemostasis than histamine 2 receptor blockers. The efficacy of proton pump blockers is higher in the case of a continuous intravenous infusion than in the inter-mittent mode of administration of the drug. The need for highly elaborate strategy for the prophylaxis of bleeding from the upper parts of gastrointestinal tract in intensive care units is essential, because when it occurs in intensive care units, mortality is high, and therapeutic options become narrow.\n[9]: Objectives: Stress ulcer prophylaxis is commonly administered to critically ill patients for the prevention of clinically important stress-related mucosal bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract. Despite widespread incorporation of stress ulcer prophylaxis into practice around the world, questions are emerging about its indications and impact. This clinically focused article will review current controversies related to stress ulcer prophylaxis for critically ill adult patients, including bleeding frequency, risk factors, comparative efficacy, adverse effect profile, and overall cost-effectiveness of the available stress ulcer prophylaxis regimens. Data Sources: A MEDLINE search was conducted from inception through August 2015. Study Selection: Selected publications describing stress ulcer prophylaxis in adult patients were retrieved (original research, systematic reviews, and practice guidelines); their bibliographies were also reviewed to identify additional pertinent publications. Data Extraction: Data from relevant publications were abstracted and summarized. Data Synthesis: The existing evidence is organized to describe the patients most likely to benefit from stress ulcer prophylaxis, review the comparative efficacy of proton pump inhibitors and histamine 2 receptor antagonists, the adverse effects of stress ulcer prophylaxis, and overall cost-effectiveness. Conclusions: Many stress ulcer prophylaxis recommendations are based on older studies at risk of bias, which may not be applicable to modern practice. Stress ulcer prophylaxis should be limited to patients considered to be at high risk for clinically important bleeding. When evaluating only the trials at low risk for bias, the evidence does not clearly support lower bleeding rates with proton pump inhibitors over histamine 2 receptor antagonists; however, proton pump inhibitors appear to be the dominant drug class used worldwide today. The current rate of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and the relative adverse effects of acid suppression on infectious risk may drive not only the effectiveness, but also the cost-effectiveness of stress ulcer prophylaxis today. Research is currently underway to better address these issues.",

Aim of the study was to determine the effect of oral/enteral nutrition with or without concomitant pantoprazole on upper GI bleeding in low risk critically ill patients. Materials and methods: This was a prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter study conducted with intensive care unit (ICU) patients receiving oral/enteral nutritional support. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups including intervention group (received oral/EN plus pantoprazole) and control group (received only oral/EN). Results: A total of 300 patients (intervention group: 152, control group: 148) participated in the study. Overall, 226 (75%) patients were fed by orally and 74 (25%) patients fed by enteral tube feeding. Median duration of nutritional support 4 (range: 2\u00e2\u0080\u009333) days.

The long-term prognosis is of obvious interest to both patients and physicians. We conducted this study to determine the prognosis and risk factors in patients diagnosed with HS. Objectives To describe the long-term prognosis and the clinical course of HS and its association to known risk factors. Methods A postal follow-up survey with uncomplicated factual questions was conducted. As all of the patients were well acquainted with their long-standing disease, this was thought to be sufficient for meaningful results. All cases were diagnosed by a dermatologist. Overall, 212 patients diagnosed with HS between 1981 and 2001 were studied after a median follow-up period of 22 years (range 12-32). Results The overall response rate was 71\u00c2\u00b72%, with 60\u00c2\u00b78% (129/212) valid (fully completed) questionnaires. Remission was reported by 39\u00c2\u00b74% (50/127) and improvement by 31\u00c2\u00b75% (40/127). Unchanged severity was reported by 20\u00c2\u00b75% (26/127), and 8\u00c2\u00b77% (11/127) experienced worsening disease. Tobacco smoking was reported by 92\u00c2\u00b72% (119/129). Among nonsmokers, 40% (35/88) reported remission vs. 29% (17/59) of active smokers. A higher proportion of nonobese patients (45%) reported remission than obese patients (23%). Conclusions We found that 39\u00c2\u00b74% of the sample reported remission of HS. Suspected risk factors appeared to influence the prognosis. Smoking and obesity were significantly linked to a lower rate of self-reported remission. The notion that lifestyle factors play a role in HS appears to be supported by this survey. What's already known about this topic? Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) causes considerable morbidity. Smoking and obesity are suggested exogenous risk factors, and inheritance has an influence on development of HS. Some patients with HS experience remission. What does this study add? Nonsmoking and nonobesity are linked to a better chance of remission from HS. In this cohort 39% of patients experienced remission. New long-term follow-up data describing the clinical course of HS are presented.",

Management of Chronic Complications: Automated red cell exchange transfusions can lower the number of circulating sickle erythrocytes without causing iron overload, which is a significant concern with regular transfusions [1, 8, 13].\n #Reference: [1] Blood transfusion remains an important therapeutic intervention in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), aiming to both increase the oxygen carrying capacity of blood and to reduce the complications of vaso-occlusion. Simple, manual exchange and automated exchange can be effective in reducing the acute and chronic complications of SCD, and the advantages and disadvantages of each methodology mean they all have a role in different situations. Evidence for the role of emergency transfusion in the management of the acute complications of SCD, including acute pain and acute chest syndrome, comes from observational data. Several important randomized controlled trials have shown the efficacy of transfusion in primary and secondary stroke prevention in patients with SCD but, outside these areas, clinical practice lacks a clear evidence base. Evidence for the role of long-term transfusion in the prevention of the non-neurologic chronic complications of SCD comes from analysis of secondary outcomes of these randomized trials and from observational data. In view of the paucity of data, the risks and benefits of transfusion should be fully discussed with patients/families before a long-term transfusion program is commenced. Evidence is only available for the role of preoperative transfusion or for prophylactic transfusion through pregnancy in certain situations, and the role of transfusions outside these situations is discussed. Questions about when and how to transfuse in SCD remain and will need further randomized trials to provide answers. [8] Sickle cell patients often require monthly transfusions with normal blood to treat the many complications of the disease. In this therapy, the clinician lowers the amount of hemoglobin S (HbS) containing red blood cells (RBCs) by transfusing normal blood units containing hemoglobin A (HbA). We have developed a point-of-care (POC) quantitative immunoassay for HbS to serve as a diagnostic aid for clinicians providing this life-saving treatment. The test consists of a small-footprint reader and cartridges that quantify the percentage of HbS in a small volume of patient blood. The test reports % HbS values in the range from 5 to 86% that highly correlate (slope 1.03, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.97) with currently used central laboratory HPLC systems. The test also shows a 1% limit of blank, 2% limit of detection, and 5% limit of quantitation. The test was also shown to encounter minimal effects from potential interferences. This cost-effective, POC HbS quantitative approach will allow for real-time transfusion monitoring in sickle cell treatment settings and therefore improve workflow and allow clinicians to quickly make informed therapeutic decisions. [13] Hydroxyurea (HU) has been used clinically to reduce the frequency of painful crisis and the need for blood transfusion in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. However, the mechanisms underlying such beneficial effects of HU treatment are still not fully understood. Studies have indicated a weak correlation between clinical outcome and molecular markers, and the scientific quest to develop companion biophysical markers have mostly targeted studies of blood properties under hypoxia. Using a common-path interferometric technique, we measure biomechanical and morphological properties of individual red blood cells in SCD patients as a function of cell density, and investigate the correlation of these biophysical properties with drug intake as well as other clinically measured parameters. Our results show that patient-specific HU effects on the cellular biophysical properties are detectable at normoxia, and that these properties are strongly correlated with the clinically measured mean cellular volume rather than fetal hemoglobin level.",

        "input": "#Claim: Key Points: Exercise and Lactate: Exercise-induced lactate production is linked to various metabolic benefits, including improved insulin sensitivity and weight control. Lactate transporters (MCT1 and MCT4) play a crucial role in these processes, and their expression is influenced by exercise intensity [2, 5].\n #Reference: [2]: Two lactate/proton cotransporter isoforms (monocarboxylate transporters, MCT1 and MCT4) are present in the plasma (sarcolemmal) membranes of skeletal muscle. Both isoforms are symports and are involved in both muscle pH and lactate regulation. Accordingly, sarcolemmal MCT isoform expression may play an important role in exercise performance. Acute exercise alters human MCT content, within the first 24 h from the onset of exercise. The regulation of MCT protein expression is complex after acute exercise, since there is not a simple concordance between changes in mRNA abundance and protein levels. In general, exercise produces greater increases in MCT1 than in MCT4 content. Chronic exercise also affects MCT1 and MCT4 content, regardless of the initial fitness of subjects. On the basis of cross-sectional studies, intensity would appear to be the most important factor regulating exercise-induced changes in MCT content. Regulation of skeletal muscle MCT1 and MCT4 content by a variety of stimuli inducing an elevation of lactate level (exercise, hypoxia, nutrition, metabolic perturbations) has been demonstrated. Dissociation between the regulation of MCT content and lactate transport activity has been reported in a number of studies, and changes in MCT content are more common in response to contractile activity, whereas changes in lactate transport capacity typically occur in response to changes in metabolic pathways. Muscle MCT expression is involved in, but is not the sole determinant of, muscle H <sup>+</sup>and lactate anion exchange during physical activity. \u00c2\u00a9 2012 the American Physiological Society.\n[5]: Purpose: Increased blood lactate concentration has been suggested as a primary stimulus for the exercise-induced growth hormone response (EIGR). Patients with McArdle disease are unable to produce lactate in response to exercise and thus offer a unique model to assess the role of lactate in the EIGR. Accordingly, McArdle's patients were exercised to test the hypothesis that lactate is a major stimulus of the EIGR. Methods: 11 patients with McArdle disease (3 male, 8 female; age: 35.5 (SD 13.9) years, height: 166 (8) cm, body mass: 75.2 (13.1) kg) were recruited for the study. The patients walked initially at 0.42 m/s, increasing by 0.14 m/s per 3 min stage. Exercise was terminated when participants completed 3 minutes at 1.80 m/s or when a Borg CR10 pain scale rating of \"4\" was reached. Stages were separated by 60 s for capillary blood sampling for analysis of hGH and blood lactate concentration. Results: McArdle's patients' blood lactate levels remained at resting levels (0.3-1.2 mmol/l) as exercise intensity increased. Nine out of 11 participants failed to demonstrate an EIGR obtaining hGH values below the clinical definition of a response (>3 \u00ce\u00bcg/l). Conclusion: The absence of an EIGR in nine out of 11 participants suggests that lactate could play a major role in the EIGR in humans.",

Until a few years ago, only clinical and histological features were exploited for MB pathological classification and outcome prognosis. In the past decade, the advancement of high-throughput molecular analyses that integrate genetic, epigenetic, and expression data, together with the availability of increasing wealth of patient samples, revealed the existence of four molecularly distinct MB subgroups. Their further classification into 12 subtypes not only reduced the well-characterized intertumoral heterogeneity, but also provided new opportunities for the design of targets for precision oncology. Moreover, the identification of tumorigenic and self-renewing subpopulations of cancer stem cells in MB has increased our knowledge of its biology. Despite these advancements, the origin of MB is still debated, and its molecular bases are poorly characterized. A major goal in the field is to identify the key genes that drive tumor growth and the mechanisms through which they are able to promote tumorigenesis. So far, only protein-coding genes acting as oncogenic drivers have been characterized in each MB subgroup. The contribution of the non-coding side of the genome, which produces a plethora of transcripts that control fundamental biological processes, as the cell choice between proliferation and differentiation, is still unappreciated. This review wants to fill this major gap by summarizing the recent findings on the impact of non-coding RNAs in MB initiation and progression. Furthermore, their potential role as specific MB biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets is also highlighted.\n[3]: Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Currently, \u00c2\u00bbone-size-fits-all\u00c2\u00bb radiation and chemotherapy treatment regimen is employed for treating MB patient, causing at least some children to undergo highly aggressive and in some cases, inadequate radiation therapy. Consequently, there is a need for prognostic and predictive tools for identifying disease aggressiveness and ultimately which patients with MB may be able to benefit from de-escalation of therapy. Genomic characterization of MB has recently identified 4 distinct molecular subgroups: Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), Wingless (WNT), Group 3, Group 4 each exhibiting different clinical behavior. The molecular sub-types have unique risk-profiles and outcomes, and patients could potentially benefit from sub-group specific treatments. However, the transition of these molecular MB subtypes into clinical practice has been limited due to challenges in availability of molecular profiling in most hospitals, as well as variability in clinical assessment. In this work, we present a radiomic feature that captures subtle tissue deformations caused due to the impact of tumor growth on the normal-appearing brain around tumor (BAT), to distinguish molecular sub-types of MB. First, we obtain voxel-wise deformation magnitude from the deformation orientations, after registering Gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced T1-w MRI scan for every study to a normal age-specific T1w MRI template. Deformation statistics are then computed within every 5mm annular BAT region, 0 < d < 60mm, where d is the distance from the tumor infiltrating edge, to capture subtle localized deformation changes around the tumor. Our results using multi-class comparison via one-way ANOVA and post-hoc comparison showed significant differences across deformation magnitudes obtained for Group 3, Group 4, and SHH molecular sub-types, observed up to 15-mm outside the infiltrating edge. Our feasibility results suggest that the subtle deformation features in BAT observed on routine Gd-T1w MRI may potentially serve as surrogate markers to non-invasively characterize molecular sub-types of pediatric MB.\n[4]: Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Although multimodality treatment regimens including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy have greatly improved disease outcome, about one-third of MB patient remains incurable, and many long-term survivors are suffered from deleterious effects due to aggressive treatment. Understanding the signaling pathways and the genetic mechanisms contributed to MB development would be the key to develop novel therapeutic treatment strategies for improving survival and outcome of MB. In this review, we discuss the biological signaling pathways involved in MB pathogenesis. We also go through the current international consensus of four core MB subgroups namely, SHH, WNT, Group 3, and Group 4. This is adopted based on the knowledge of genomic complexity of MB as analyzed by recent high-throughput genomic technology. We talk about immunohistochemistry assays established to determine molecular subgroup affiliation. In the last part of review, we discuss how identification of molecular subgroups is going to change our routine disease diagnosis and clinical management.\n[6]: Purpose of review: Most children diagnosed with cancer today are expected to be cured. Medulloblastoma, the most common pediatric malignant brain tumor, is an example of a disease that has benefitted from advances in diagnostic imaging, surgical techniques, radiation therapy and combination chemotherapy over the past decades. It was an incurable disease 50 years ago, but approximately 70% of children with medulloblastoma are now cured of their disease. However, the pace of increasing the cure rate has slowed over the past 2 decades, and we have likely reached the maximal benefit that can be achieved with cytotoxic therapy and clinical risk stratification. Long-term toxicity of therapy also remains significant. To increase cure rates and decrease long-term toxicity, there is great interest in incorporating biologic 'targeted' therapy into treatment of medulloblastoma, but this will require a paradigm shift in how we classify and study disease. Recent findings: Using genome-based high-throughput analytic techniques, several groups have independently reported methods of molecular classification of medulloblastoma within the past year. This has resulted in a working consensus to view medulloblastoma as four molecular subtypes, including wingless-type murine mammary tumor virus integration site (WNT) pathway subtype, Sonic Hedgehog pathway subtype and two less well defined subtypes (groups C and D). Summary: Novel classification and risk stratification based on biologic subtypes of disease will form the basis of further study in medulloblastoma and identify specific subtypes that warrant greater research focus. \u00c2\u00a9 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",

Current therapy for these children most often includes a multi-modality approach including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. With modern therapy, overall survival for medulloblastoma is approximately 80% while survival for sPNET is 30\u00e2\u0080\u009350%. Factors associated with prognosis include the presence of disseminated disease, extent of surgical resection and patient age, with children <3 years categorized as high risk patients given the inability to deliver high dose radiation at this young age due to significant long term effects. Increasingly, there is great interest in further sub-grouping patients based on molecular profiling which is highly predictive of outcome. While four molecular subgroups have emerged for medulloblastoma, the sub-grouping of sPNET has proved more challenging with an increasing awareness that this is a heterogeneous group in which histological diagnosis is challenging. The current challenges for both medulloblastoma and sPNET include the determination of optimal therapy for children such as decreased therapy for favorable risk groups and intensification and targeted therapy for high risk groups. Additionally, data are now available for long-term survivors which detail the significant effects of therapy in this young population.\n[10]: Background: High-risk medulloblastoma is defined by the presence of metastatic disease and/or incomplete resection and/or unfavorable histopathology and/or tumors with MYC amplification. We aimed to assess the 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and define the molecular characteristics associated with PFS in patients aged 5-19 years with newly diagnosed high-risk medulloblastoma treated according to the phase II trial PNET HR+5. Methods: All children received postoperative induction chemotherapy (etoposide and carboplatin), followed by 2 high-dose thiotepa courses (600 mg/m2) with hematological stem cell support. At the latest 45 days after the last stem cell rescue, patients received risk-Adapted craniospinal radiation therapy. Maintenance treatment with temozolomide was planned to start between 1-3 months after the end of radiotherapy. The primary endpoint was PFS. Outcome and safety analyses were per protocol (all patients who received at least one dose of induction chemotherapy). Results: Fifty-one patients (median age, 8 y; range, 5-19) were enrolled. The median follow-up was 7.1 years (range: 3.4-9.0). The 3 and 5-year PFS with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were 78% (65-88) and 76% (63-86), and the 3 and 5-year OS were 84% (72-92) and 76% (63-86), respectively. Medulloblastoma subtype was a statistically significant prognostic factor (P-value = 0.039) with large-cell/anaplastic being of worse prognosis, as well as a molecular subgroup (P-value = 0.012) with sonic hedgehog (SHH) and group 3 being of worse prognosis than wingless (WNT) and group 4. Therapy was well tolerated. Conclusions: This treatment based on high-dose chemotherapy and conventional radiotherapy resulted in a high survival rate in children with newly diagnosed high-risk medulloblastoma.",

The classical therapeutic approach consists of surgical resection, followed by craniospinal irradiation. Because of the good overall survival (75%), the main recent research efforts focus on refining the most relevant prognostic stratification and in decreasing the long-term sequelae. Recent Findings: Thanks to the better understanding of the heterogeneity of medulloblastomas, clinical, histological and biological markers have been clearly identified and allow risk-adapted strategies. A subset of tumours of early childhood (<3-5 years), frequently associated with a Sonic Hedgehog signalling, might be cured without irradiation. In older children, several trials have demonstrated the safety of reduced craniospinal irradiation in standard risk tumours. Furthermore, the evidence of an excellent prognosis associated with a subset of tumours characterized by an activation of the WNT pathway leads to forthcoming de-escalating strategies. Reducing long-term sequelae also relies on new surgical approaches aiming at reducing the cerebellar injuries. Tremendous efforts have also been made in defining the most adapted irradiation doses and fields. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy and proton beam therapy might also influence the long-term neurological and endocrine defects of the patients. Summary: Histological and biological characteristics clearly define various prognostic groups within medulloblastomas; confirming the overall good outcome and reducing long-term sequelae are the main focus of current clinical trials. \u00c2\u00a9 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.\n[12]: The aim of this study is to assess treatment results of 48 pediatric high-risk medulloblastoma cases that were treated by surgery, radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. The impact of adjuvant combination chemotherapy on treatment results will be assessed. Forty-eight cases of pediatric high-risk medulloblastoma treated from July 2001 to July 2004 were randomized into two groups. The first (group I) included 21 patients who received postoperative craniospinal radiation therapy (36Gy+boost 20Gy to the posterior fossa). The second (group II) included 27 cases who received postoperative combination cranio-spinal radiation therapy (with the same dose as the first group) and chemotherapy (vincristine, etoposide, cisplatin). Both groups were compared as regards overall survival (OS), disease free survival (DFS), response rate and treatment toxicity. In-group I, complete remission (CR) was achieved in 71.4% of the cases; partial remission (PR) in 14.3% of the patients; stationary disease (SD) in 14.3% and none of the cases suffered from progressive disease. The three-year OS was 69.5% and the three-year DFS was 61.3%. In-group II, CR was achieved in 59.3% of the cases; PR in 3.7%; SD in 3.7% and PD in 37.3% of the cases. The three-year OS was 48.4% and the 3-year DFS was 48.9%. Regarding acute treatment toxicity in group I, nine patients (31.5%) developed grade I myelo-suppression and seven cases (24.5%) developed grade II myelo-suppression with three to five days treatment interruption. Whereas in group II, 13 patients (45.5%) developed grade I myelosuppression and seven cases (24.5%) developed grade II myelo-suppression requiring interruption of treatment for a period ranging from five to seven days with spontaneous recovery. In group I no other acute toxicity was recognized, whereas in group II other toxicities related to chemotherapy were noticed. For example, three patients (11%) developed peripheral neuritis during the course of treatment and two patients (7%) developed renal impairment, which responded to medical treatment. Late treatment toxicity, manifested as reduction in intelligence quotient (IQ), was noticed, which makes conventional treatment of medulloblastoma unsatisfactory. In group I; 13 patients (62%) suffered a reduction of 8-20% in IQ in comparison to their normal siblings, whereas in Group II; 13 patients (48%) developed a reduction in IQ ranging from 12-21%. CONCLUSION: The current treatment of medulloblasotma has a detrimental effect on long-term survivors. Whereas acute toxicity is considered mild and tolerable, late toxicity regarding diminution in IQ makes current treatment unsatisfactory because of the long-term mental disability of the cured patients. We believe that, the poorer outcome in the chemo-radiation group was due to the treatment interruption during radiation therapy caused by myelosuppression since the incidence of myelosuppression was higher in the chemo-radiation group and the recovery time was longer.\n[13]: With improved survivorship in medulloblastoma, there has been an increasing incidence of late complications. To date, no studies have specifically addressed the risk of radiation-associated diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) in medulloblastoma survivors. Query of the International DIPG Registry identified six cases of DIPG with a history of medulloblastoma treated with radiotherapy. All patients underwent central radiologic review that confirmed a diagnosis of DIPG. Six additional cases were identified in reports from recent cooperative group medulloblastoma trials (total n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00e2\u0080\u008912; ages 7 to 21\u00c2\u00a0years). From these cases, molecular subgrouping of primary medulloblastomas with available tissue (n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00e2\u0080\u00895) revealed only non-WNT, non-SHH subgroups (group 3 or 4). The estimated cumulative incidence of DIPG after post-treatment medulloblastoma ranged from 0.3-3.9%. Posterior fossa radiation exposure (including brainstem) was greater than 53.0\u00c2\u00a0Gy in all cases with available details. Tumor/germline exome sequencing of three radiation-associated DIPGs revealed an H3 wild-type status and mutational signature distinct from primary DIPG with evidence of radiation-induced DNA damage. Mutations identified in the radiation-associated DIPGs had significant molecular overlap with recurrent drivers of adult glioblastoma (e.g. NRAS, EGFR, and PTEN), as opposed to epigenetic dysregulation in H3-driven primary DIPGs. Patients with radiation-associated DIPG had a significantly worse median overall survival (median 8\u00c2\u00a0months; range 4-17\u00c2\u00a0months) compared to patients with primary DIPG. Here, it is demonstrated that DIPG occurs as a not infrequent complication of radiation therapy in survivors of pediatric medulloblastoma and that radiation-associated DIPGs may present as a poorly-prognostic distinct molecular subgroup of H3 wild-type DIPG. Given the abysmal survival of these cases, these findings provide a compelling argument for efforts to reduce exposure of the brainstem in the treatment of medulloblastoma. Additionally, patients with radiation-associated DIPG may benefit from future therapies targeted to the molecular features of adult glioblastoma rather than primary DIPG.",

Patients and methods The study was conducted at Departments of Medicine and Dermatology, Sir Syed College of Medical Sciences and Hospital Karachi from 1<sup>st</sup> January 2014 till 30<sup>th</sup> June 2014. Patients belonging to both sexes and different age groups having body mass index (BMI) \u00e2\u0089\u00a525kg/m<sup>2</sup> with cutaneous manifestations of obesity were enrolled. Patients with skin changes secondary to other systemic illnesses, pregnancy and drugs were excluded. After an informed consent, demographic details, height and weight were documented. A clinical dermatological diagnosis was established after a detailed history and examination. Appropriate investigations were performed where required. Results 196 patients, 76 males (39%) and 120 females (61%) completed the study. Mean age was 43.6\u00c2\u00b110.8 years, age range being 19-70 years. Mean BMI 34\u00c2\u00b14.73 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (range 25-50), grade I obesity in 75 (38%) and grade II obesity in 121 (62%) cases. The most common finding observed was acanthosis nigricans (49%), followed by striae (17%), fungal infections (15%), acrochordons (12%), viral infections (11%), hirsutism (11%) and bacterial infections (7.5%). Other less common associations included: xanthomas, corns, plantar hyperkeratosis and acne. Acanthosis nigricans and viral infections were significantly more among females; corn and callus among males. Obesity grade II was significantly associated with acanthosis nigricans, viral infections, hirsutism, striae and stasis dermatitis. Conclusion Obesity is commonly associated with a wide range of dermatological manifestations like acanthosis nigricans, striae, hirsutism, skin infections. Other less common associations include: xanthomas, corns, plantar hyperkeratosis and acne.\n[2]: Background: Skin tags (STs) are benign skin lesions. Their definite etiology remains unknown. We aim to examine the association of obesity, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, thyroid abnormalities, acanthosis nigricans, and multiple STs in a Greek primary population. Methods: Phototype and body weight were recorded. Fasting serum blood samples were analyzed for cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, glucose, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Univariate ordinal logistic regression multivariate analysis was performed. Results: The univariate analysis showed that patients who were overweight with Fitzpatrick Skin Type III, acanthosis nigricans, and hypothyroidism were more likely to present with multiple skin tags as compared with patients at a normal weight with Skin Type I. Statistically significant associations were also found with the presence of cholesterol and triglycerides. In the multivariate analysis, a significant association between hypercholesterolemia and STs was demonstrated. Those with skin tags were more likely to have hypothyroidism. Conclusion: STs are often associated with obesity. An association between lipid profile and STs has been reported. Multiple STs have been independently associated with acanthosis nigricans. Although a possible relationship between STs and thyroid disease has not yet been proved, our review reveals a possible trend. Future investigations with larger sample sizes might clarify the association between skin tags and hypothyroidism.",

        "input": "#Claim: Impact of Bariatric Surgery: Clinical Manifestations: These deficiencies can result in skin conditions like alopecia, impaired wound healing, and dermatitis [3, 4].\n #Reference: [3]: Bariatric surgery leads to a significant body weight reduction, and improvement of obesity-related comorbidities. However, it is associated with a higher risk of presenting some nutritional deficiencies. These deficiencies are especially relevant after mixed or malabsorptive procedures. Deficiencies in micronutrients after bariatric procedures are a known threat if not corrected appropriately. Though zinc deficiency is not considered among the most frequent deficiencies after bariatric surgery, several studies have shown that its frequency might overcome 10%, even after restrictive procedures and in patients with multivitamin supplements intake.Zinc is the second most prevalent trace found in the human body after iron. It is essential for normal cell function and metabolism, playing a central role in over 300 enzymatic reactions, and protects cells from free radical damage. The central role of zinc in cell growth and differentiation explains the dramatic effect of zinc deficiency in tissues with a rapid cell turnover such as hair growth. In recent years much interest has been generated by the possibility that subclinical zinc deficiency may significantly increase the incidence of and morbidity and mortality from diarrhea and upper respiratory tract infections. Clinical manifestations of zinc deficiency include delayed sexual maturation, impotence, hypogonadism, oligospermia, alopecia, dysgeusia, immune dysfunction, night blindness, impaired wound healing, and various skin lesions. After bariatric surgery, zinc deficiency is often associated with other micronutrients deficiencies, mainly iron. It has been demonstrated that zinc and iron levels, both within the normal range, but close to the minimum level of the range, can be associated with hair loss, mainly between the 6th and 9th postoperative month. For the evaluation of zinc status, plasma levels are generally a good index of zinc status in healthy individuals. Zinc supplements are usually indicated for patients with low zinc levels, depending upon the clinical context. In obese patients after bariatric surgery, zinc supplementation can be considered even in patients with serum levels within the normal range, when iron levels are also close to the minimum value of normality and the patient complain of alopecia.\n[4]: Introduction: Bariatric surgery is a very effective treatment for obesity. After gastric bypass, micronutrient deficiencies frequently occur which can have dramatic consequences. Case report: We report the case of a 55-year-old woman who was admitted for psychomotor retardation, bilateral leg pitting edema and psoriasis-like rash that had been ongoing for 3 months. Pancytopenia, encephalopathy and heart failure rapidly occurred leading to multiorgan dysfunction syndrome and death. We retrospectively identified severe selenium deficiency with possible secondary cardiomyopathy, niacin deficiency resulting in pellagrous encephalopathy with skin lesions and gelatinous transformation of bone marrow. Conclusion: Micronutrient deficiency should systematically be assessed when new symptoms occur in a patient with a history of bariatric surgery. Selenium deficiency should be considered in the presence of any heart failure in this context.",

METHODS Patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China during Jan 2009 to Nov 2016 were included. General characteristics as well as clinical data were collected, including blood routine, serum biochemical analysis, endoscopic findinds, histological evaluation and comorbiditie. Statistical analyses was performed using SPSS 20.0 software for Windows (IBM Inc., Chicago, IL, United States) using Student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s t-test, Mann-WhitneyU test,\u00cf\u0087<sup>2</sup> test, univariable and multivariable logistic analysis. 2-tailed P value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS A total of 176006 endoscopies were retrieved and we included 1370 xanthelasma participants (703 men, 667 women) in this study. Prevalence of xanthelasma was 0.78% with average age of 56.6 \u00c2\u00b1 11.2 years. Chief complaint of xanthelasma consisted abdominal pain (24.2%), up-abdominal discomfort (14.1%), abdominal distention (10.1%), dyspepsia (9.1%), et al . Most xanthelasma occurred as single lesion in gastric antrum. Xanthelasma patients witnessed higher Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori ) infection rate, more of other gastric lesions including atrophy, intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia (P < 0.01). In xanthelasma patients, serum carcinoembryonic antigen, triglyceride, fasting glucose, neutrophil, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were significantly higher, and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, lymphocyte was lower (P < 0.05). Xanthelasma accompanied with more fatty liver disease and hepatic cyst, but fewer gallbladder polyp (P < 0.05). In logistic regression, it revealed that fasting plasma glucose (OR = 3.347, 1.170-9.575, P < 0.05), neutrophil (OR = 1.617, 1.003-2.605, P < 0.05), and carcinoembryonic antigen (OR = 2.011, 1.236-3.271, P < 0.01) were all independent risk factors in xanthelasma. CONCLUSION Current study described a large xanthelasma cohort in Chinese population, revealed its relationship with H. pylori infection, carcinogenesis, metabolic dysfunction and inflammation as well.",

Folic acid, alone or in combination with other B vitamins, is the most recommended vitamin consumed during pregnancy because deficiency of this vitamin leads to birth defects in the infant. Folic acid and other B vitamins are also integral components of biochemical processes that are essential to the development of regulatory systems that control the ability of the offspring to adapt to the external environment. Although few human studies have investigated the lasting effects of high vitamin intakes during pregnancy, animal models have shown that excess vitamin supplementation during gestation is associated with negative metabolic effects in both the mothers and their offspring. This research from animal models, combined with the recognition that epigenetic regulation of gene expression is plastic, provides evidence for further examination of these relationships in the later life of pregnant women and their children.\n[2]: Folic acid has become recognised as an important nutrient during pregnancy. The following review highlights the significant developments in recognising folic acid importance in fetal development. \u00c2\u00a9 2008 Informa UK Ltd.\n[3]: Government guidelines stress the need for pregnant women to have a balanced diet and to take certain vitamins and minerals. Midwives have a role in promoting healthy eating during pregnancy, particularly as pregnant women are faced with constant media messages about a healthy diet. Many women who have babies with a low birth weight are from low income backgrounds and are unable to provide themselves with an adequate diet. It is well documented that bobeis born underweight are more likely to suffer from illnesses and disabilities. Folic acid is an essential supplement for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy as it is proven to reduce the incidence of neural tube defects in babies. Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are fast becoming recognized as an important supplement for mothers, to ensure good brain development in the baby and a longer gestation period which increases birth weight.\n[4]: In the late 1930s, it was discovered that liver and yeast extracts can be used to correct certain cases of megaloblastic anemia in pregnancy. The factor responsible for this was isolated from spinach leaves in the 1940s, and referred to as folate, a\u00c2\u00a0term derived from the Latin word folium for leaf. Folate is considered an essential nutrient for human beings. Folic acid, the synthetic form of the vitamin, is used in dietary supplements, medicines and fortified foods. Since the 1980s, it has been recommended that women who plan to become pregnant and pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy take folic acid supplements. This recommendation was based on studies that revealed that periconceptional folic acid supplementation can reduce the risk for neural tube defects (NTDs). Many countries later implemented folic acid fortification programs. The resulting population-wide increase of folic acid intakes led to significant reductions in NTD rates. However, a\u00c2\u00a0temporarily increased colorectal cancer incidence has been reported to coincide with the fortification programs in the USA and Canada. On the basis of currently available data from experimental and human studies it can be concluded that the association between folate/folic acid and cancer is rather complex: Folate intake in the range of the dietary reference intake (DRI) is associated with a\u00c2\u00a0reduced risk for cancer in healthy populations, whereas high intakes of folic acid might result in an increased risk for cancer incidence or progression in persons with precancerous lesions and under certain conditions. Since no adverse effects have been observed in association with the intake of dietary folate, research activities that aim at investigating cause and effect relationships focus on folic acid.",

        "input": "#Claim: Combined Effects: Systemic Effects: Metal particles released into the body can have systemic effects, including potential cytotoxic, carcinogenic, and allergic reactions. The extent of these effects can be influenced by the amount of wear particles generated, which is affected by both body weight and physical activity levels [5, 6].\n #Reference: [5]: Modern metal-on-metal bearings show very low wear rates but release particles and ions from the articulating surfaces into the joint and the whole organism. Especially during the run-in period an increased number of particles is produced. The released metal ions potentially trigger cytotoxic, cancerogenic and allergic reactions, which can impair the patient's health locally or systemically. Many surgeons fear a hypersensitivity reaction to the metal ions of the CoCr alloy in their patients. Today it is assumed that the incidence of these implant-related complications is very low but in some cases it will lead to early failure of the implant. Because the available alternative bearing combinations (ceramic-on-polyethylene and ceramic-on-ceramic) also bear the risk of severe complications, a final statement on the best and safest bearing choice for the patient cannot be made based on the currently existing data. \u00c2\u00a9 2008 Springer Medizin Verlag.\n[6]: BACKGROUND: Studies demonstrated that wear particles can lead to aseptic loosening of the prosthesis, and spread to the whole body, and have systemic effects on multiple systems. OBJECTIVE: To summarize research status and new progress of the generation, characteristics of wear particles, and pathways that are transferred to the body, as well as effects of different wear particles on systemic multi-system. METHODS: We retrieved database of CNKI and PubMed for particles concerning wear particles after artificial joint replacement published from January 1999 to April 2016. The articles regarding effects of wear particles on prosthesis loosening were excluded. Key words were \u00e2\u0080\u009cwear particles\u00e2\u0080\u009d. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Regardless of the fixation or prosthesis material used for artificial joint replacement, friction between the prosthesis and fretting between the prosthesis and the bone interface can produce wear particles. At present, there are no clinical complications of short-term effects of bone cement, polyethylene, ceramic wear particles on human. In contrast, systemic reactions caused by metal wear particles are more common. The metal ions not only affect the whole body, but also can cause damage to the human body. Nowadays, the research on the mechanism of prosthesis replacement wear particles mainly concerns in vitro cells, but there are few complete animal models. Scholars generally agreed that particle-mediated disease has a long-term latency; the long-term effects of exposure to metal particles are still unclear, and need to be explored.",

Intra-class correlations (ICCs) and the Pitman's statistic were calculated. Results Among CHWs, ICCs pooled across the six sites (924 infants) were 0.96 (95% CI 0.95-0.96) for MUAC and 0.71 (95% CI 0.68-0.74) for WFLz.

NCI data from 2005-2007 have suggested that 1.93% of individuals born today in the US will develop melanoma at some stage. Approximately 15% of patients with MM either present with metastatic disease or develop metastases during the course of their illness. Unfortunately, metastatic MM remains a challenge with limited treatment options, and median overall survival is 6-9 months. Methods. We reviewed our data for the treatment of metastatic MM over a period of four years. Data from all patients with metastatic MM treated with systemic therapy without clinical trials from 2006 to 2009 were reviewed. Response rate was determined as per RECIST criteria. Results. Sixty four patients were treated with one or more lines of cytotoxic therapy. Median age was 62 years (range, 23-82) with 53% males. Primary site of the disease was the skin in 75%, mucosal in 12.5%, ocular in 9.4% and nodal with an occult primary in 3.1%. Visceral metastases were present in 75% of patients at the start of treatment, including pulmonary (39.6%) and hepatic (34.4%). All patients were screened for brain metastases, which were present in 26.5% of patients. ECOG performance status was 0 in 7.8%, 1 in 68.7%, 2 in 9.4% and undocumented in the remaining 14%. Patients without brain metastases received single agent DTIC as first line; those with brain metastases received temozolomide. Response rate was 7% for DTIC and 28% for temozolomide, with median progression-free survival of 2.4 and 3.2 months, respectively. Seven patients who received DTIC are alive on follow-up, 2 have ongoing stable disease post-DTIC at 41 months and 18 months. Second line therapy with vinblastine was given to 21 patients (32%), with a response rate of 9.5% and median progression-free survival of 3.4 months. Median overall survival from initiation of therapy was 7.7 months for DTIC and 3.6 months for patients with brain metastases receiving temozolomide. A performance status of 2 was associated with shorter median overall survival (2.0 months). Conclusions. Our results are comparable to published data.

        "input": "#Claim: Conclusion: The percentage of individuals achieving remission from advanced skin cancer varies significantly based on the treatment modality. While traditional chemotherapy offers limited remission rates, newer treatments like immune-checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies show more promise, with some patients achieving complete remission. However, the overall percentage remains relatively low, and long-term survival is still a challenge for most patients [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].\n #Reference: [1]: Aims and background. The incidence of malignant melanoma has risen steadily over recent decades. NCI data from 2005-2007 have suggested that 1.93% of individuals born today in the US will develop melanoma at some stage. Approximately 15% of patients with MM either present with metastatic disease or develop metastases during the course of their illness. Unfortunately, metastatic MM remains a challenge with limited treatment options, and median overall survival is 6-9 months. Methods. We reviewed our data for the treatment of metastatic MM over a period of four years. Data from all patients with metastatic MM treated with systemic therapy without clinical trials from 2006 to 2009 were reviewed. Response rate was determined as per RECIST criteria. Results. Sixty four patients were treated with one or more lines of cytotoxic therapy. Median age was 62 years (range, 23-82) with 53% males. Primary site of the disease was the skin in 75%, mucosal in 12.5%, ocular in 9.4% and nodal with an occult primary in 3.1%. Visceral metastases were present in 75% of patients at the start of treatment, including pulmonary (39.6%) and hepatic (34.4%). All patients were screened for brain metastases, which were present in 26.5% of patients. ECOG performance status was 0 in 7.8%, 1 in 68.7%, 2 in 9.4% and undocumented in the remaining 14%. Patients without brain metastases received single agent DTIC as first line; those with brain metastases received temozolomide. Response rate was 7% for DTIC and 28% for temozolomide, with median progression-free survival of 2.4 and 3.2 months, respectively. Seven patients who received DTIC are alive on follow-up, 2 have ongoing stable disease post-DTIC at 41 months and 18 months. Second line therapy with vinblastine was given to 21 patients (32%), with a response rate of 9.5% and median progression-free survival of 3.4 months. Median overall survival from initiation of therapy was 7.7 months for DTIC and 3.6 months for patients with brain metastases receiving temozolomide. A performance status of 2 was associated with shorter median overall survival (2.0 months). Conclusions. Our results are comparable to published data. Malignant melanoma is a disease with rising incidence and limited treatment options. These patients are best treated in the context of clinical trials as new targeted therapies are promising as future strategies. \u00c2\u00a9 Il Pensiero Scientifico Editore.\n[3]: Significant progress has been made in the treatment of metastatic melanoma during the last years. Approval of immune-checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies has been achieved recently. The sequencing of these therapies is an important issue. Here, we report our experience with the treatment and retreatment with PD1-inhibitors (PD1i) in eight patients. The patients (two female and seven male with a median age of 70 years, all melanoma stage IV, M1c) underwent a first treatment period with PD1i for a median of 5.5 months. Three (37.5%) patients had a stable disease as best response, two (25%) showed progression, two (25%) showed partial response, and one (12.5%) achieved complete remission. PD1i was discontinued due to disease progression in seven patients and due to side effects (pancreatitis) in one patient. Patients were subsequently treated with ipilimumab (n=2), or chemotherapy (n=4), or no other medical treatment (n=2). All eight patients were subsequently retreated with PD1i for a median of 2.5 months. One (12.5%) developed a partial response, whereas in three patients (37.5%) the disease was stabilized. PD1i have shown a high and durable response rate in the first-line treatment of metastatic melanoma. Our study suggests PD1i retreatment as a reasonable option for selected patients. Further investigations are needed to verify the value of PD1i re-exposure and to identify subgroups of patients who can benefit.\n[4]: The 10-year survival rate for patients with metastatic melanoma is less than 10%. Although surgery and radiation therapy have a role in the treatment of metastatic disease, systemic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for most patients. Single-agent chemotherapy is well tolerated but is associated with response rates of only 5% to 20%. Combination chemotherapy and biochemotherapy may improve objective response rates but do not extend survival and are associated with greater toxicity. Immunotherapeutic approaches such as high-dose interleukin-2 are associated with durable responses in a small percentage of patients. In this article, we review the treatments for metastatic melanoma including promising investigational approaches.\n[5]: Background: The purpose of the study was to assess the outcome of patients with advanced melanoma treated with matched molecularly targeted therapy. Patients and methods: We reviewed 160 consecutive patients with metastatic melanoma treated in the phase I program (N = 35 protocols). Treatment was considered to be 'matched' (N = 84) if at least one drug in the regimen was known to inhibit the functional activity of at least one of the patient's mutations. Results: Of 160 patients, 134 (83.7%) had adequate tissue for molecular analysis; 69% (110 of 160) had =1 mutation: 61.2% (82 of 134), BRAF; 20.7% (23 of 111), NRAS; 2.6% (2 of 77), KIT; 2.3% (1 of 44), KRAS; 20% (1 of 5), GNAQ; 11.1% (1 of 9), P53 and 2.6% (1 of 39), coexisting mutations in BRAF and PIK3CA. Eighty-four patients (52.4%) were treated with matched-targeted agents, most of whom had BRAF mutations (N = 74). Twenty-six percent of patients (41 of 160) achieved a complete or partial remission (CR/PR) [40% (34 of 84)) on a matched phase I protocol versus 9.2% (7 of 76) for those on a non-matched study (P \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 0.0001)]. The median progression-free survival (PFS) (95% CI) was longer for patients treated on a matched phase I trial than on their prior first standard treatment [5.27 (4.10, 6.44) versus 3.10 (1.92, 4.28) months, P = 0.023], but not on non-matched phase I treatment.

The aim of the study is to evaluate RR, progression- free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and treatment toxicity. Materials and methods Retrospective analysis of 11 metastatic melanoma patients treated from January 2002 to June 2008 with cisplatin 20 mg/m2 i.v. days 1-4, dacarbazine 800 mg/m2 i.v. day 1, vinblastine 1.5 mg/m2 i.v. days 1-4, interleukin (IL)-2 9 MIU/m2 s.c. 5-8 days and interferon (IFN)-?-2b 5 MIU/m2 s.c. days 5-9, 11, 13 and 15, with the support of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and antibiotics. Patients with ECOG 0, age \u00e2\u0089\u00a465 years and with measurable disease were included. The planned number of courses was 4. RR was measured by Revised Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumour (RECIST) criteria (computed tomography [CT]\u00c2\u00b1proton emission tomography [PET]). Toxicity was measured according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) common toxicity criteria. Results Observed RRs were 18% complete response (CR), 27% partial response (PR), 9% stable disease (SD) and 46% disease progression. The median PFS was 4 months (95% CI, 0-10 m), with a 23% one-year PFS. Median OS was 4.6 months (95% CI, 0.9-19 m), with a 29% one-year OS. Eighty-three percent of patients experienced grade 3-4 toxicity, mainly due to neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and fl u-like syndrome. Conclusions Treatment with BCT shows an increase in RR, some achieving durable CR; nevertheless it cannot be considered a standard treatment and should be employed only in selected patients.\n[9]: The treatment of disseminated melanoma is inadequate. The most active single agents provide brief objective response in 20% of patients, while the combination chemotherapy improves response rates without any apparent survival benefit. Median overall survival is, in fact, 7-9 months and 5 year survival is approximately 6%. Metastatic melanoma with a localization of the disease in the liver and brain are categorized as M1c and have the worst prognosis. Here we describe the history, treatment and favourable clinical outcome in a young man with liver and resected brain metastases who obtained complete remission for 6 years since chemotherapy with dacarbazine, cisplatin and vinblastine.",

Patients with cirrhosis are at greater risk for developing bacterial infection, which is associated with failure to control bleeding and higher rates of hospital mortality. Many clinical practice guidelines endorse antimicrobial prophylaxis as standard of care for cirrhotic patients. Objective: The present study was performed to characterize the use of antimicrobial therapy for patients hospitalized with acute variceal hemorrhage. Methods: Medical records of 98 patients hospitalized with suspected variceal hemorrhage were retrospectively reviewed. Results: One-half of the patients received antimicrobials at any time during their hospital admission, and in very few (24%) could prescribed therapy be considered prophylactic. Seventy-seven per cent of patients undergoing endoscopy did not receive an antimicrobial within 24 h of the procedure. Those who received antimicrobial therapy had more severe liver disease (model for end-stage liver disease scores of 19.5\u00c2\u00b110 versus 12.9\u00c2\u00b18, P<0.05; Child-Pugh class C 78% versus 65%, not significant) and worse in-hospital outcome (length of stay 17 versus 6.5 days, P<0.05; mortality 15 versus two, P<0.05). Cephalosporins were the most widely prescribed agents (45%), followed by fluoroquinolone (40%). Regimens ranged in length from single-dose administration to two weeks. Conclusions: Patients with liver disease admitted with variceal hemorrhage were often not prescribed antimicrobial therapy to reduce the risk of bacterial infection. These results imply that published practice guidelines are not being consistently observed. A large, well-designed study with mortality outcome may be required for clinical guidelines to be successfully implemented in practice. \u00c2\u00a9 2005 Pulsus Group Inc. All rights reserved.",

On the other hand, the Indonesian government set a target to achieve 23% renewable energy development by the year of 2025. Waste to energy program through the implementation of Sustainable Modular Bioreactor Landfill Gas Plant, is considered to be a powerful solution in solving the problem of energy supply and waste production.

In the public sector there are frequent conflicts of interest, whereas in the private sector, funding of such investment is deemed less attractive in terms of profit gained. Participatory funding system called resident-based financial model is used to cope this emerging problem. This funding system will be implemented in several cities whose waste management system is considered worrying. The purpose of this study is to explore the demographic factors that encourage people to participate in resident-based financial model.

This is associated to a complex three dimensional (3D) crosslinked structure and the presence of a high number of different additives inside a tire formulation. Most end-of-life tires are discarded as waste in landfills taking space or incinerated for energy recovery, especially for highly degraded rubber wastes. All these options are no longer acceptable for the environment and circular economy. However, a great deal of progress has been made on the sustainability of waste tires via recycling as this material has high potential being a source of valuable raw materials. Extensive researches were performed on using these end-of-life tires as fillers in civil engineering applications (concrete and asphalt), as well as blending with polymeric matrices (thermoplastics, thermosets or virgin rubber). Several grinding technologies, such as ambient, wet or cryogenic processes, are widely used for downsizing waste tires and converting them into ground tire rubber (GTR) with a larger specific surface area. Here, a focus is made on the use of GTR as a partial replacement in virgin rubber compounds. The paper also presents a review of the possible physical and chemical surface treatments to improve the GTR adhesion and interaction with different matrices, including rubber regeneration processes such as thermomechanical, microwave, ultrasonic and thermochemical producing regenerated tire rubber (RTR). This review also includes a detailed discussion on the effect of GTR/RTR particle size, concentration and crosslinking level on the curing, rheological, mechanical, aging, thermal, dynamic mechanical and swelling properties of rubber compounds. Finally, a conclusion on the current situation is provided with openings for future works.\n[3]: A huge amount of waste tires is generated every day in the world. This determines the search for ways to use them. The extended process of production and application of scrap tires leads to their significant mass accumulation, thus representing environmental risk. Tires are inert materials, extremely difficult to treat, and nonbiodegradable. In recent years, many plants have been built for processing, treatment, and utilization of this kind of waste. A problem has emerged to find a suitable, environmentally friendly application of the products (gaseous, liquid, and solid) from pyrolysis of the tires. Pyrolysis oil, which is a liquid product, is not suitable for direct use as fuel because of its high sulfur content. Therefore, the desulfurization of pyrolytic tire oil is an important part of the oil production process prior to its use. The objective of this article is to review the methods used for desulfurization of waste tire pyrolysis oils and the possibility of using scrap tires as a source of energy.\n[4]: The waste rubber and end-of-life tires management has become a serious environmental problem. It is well known that the best way to carry out the disposal of these wastes is through recycling by devulcanization. Therefore, in the last decades, many methods have been developed to perform this treatment. Nevertheless, the degree and quality of the achieved devulcanization is still difficult to evaluate. The Horikx theory is an approach often used for this purpose. Hence, in this work, the validity of this theory was experimentally checked. The theoretical curve that represents crosslink scission was experimentally built for sulfur-cured natural rubber, sulfur-cured natural rubber reinforced with carbon black, sulfur-cured ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber and peroxide-cured ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber. Several samples with vulcanization (or devulcanization) degree ranging from 0 to 100% were processed, and the corresponding soluble fractions and crosslink densities were measured by the swelling test. The experimental results were in good agreement with the theoretical predictions, independently of the studied material, fact that confirms the validity of the Horikx approach. This finding will contribute to improve the waste rubber devulcanization, and therefore to progress in the environmental protection.",

These plans lack clear long-term climate goals, indicating a need for better integration of sustainability in transport planning [1].\n #Reference: [1]: The overall objective of the Swedish transport policy is to ensure the economically efficient and sustainable provision of transport services for people and business throughout the country. More specifically, the transport sector shall, among other things, contribute to the achievement of environmental quality objectives in which the development of the transport system plays an important role in the achievement of the objectives. The aim of this study is to analyse if current transport planning supports this policy. This is done by analysing two recent cases: the National Infrastructure Plan 2010-2021, and the planning of Bypass Stockholm, a major road investment. Our results show that the plans are in conflict with several of the environmental quality objectives. Another interesting aspect of the planning processes is that the long-term climate goals are not included in the planning processes, neither as a clear goal nor as factor that will influence future transport systems. In this way, the long-term sustainability aspects are not present in the planning. We conclude that the two cases do not contribute to a sustainable transport system. Thus, several changes must be made in the processes, including putting up clear targets for emissions. Also, the methodology for the environmental assessments needs to be further developed and discussed. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.",

        "input": "#Claim: Key Points: Protective Functions of Mangroves: Mangroves act as natural barriers against wave action and tidal surges, which helps in mitigating coastal erosion. Their dense root systems trap sediments and reduce the energy of incoming waves [6, 7, 8].\n #Reference: [6] It is possible that climate changes and sea level fluctuations (allogenic processes) are and will cause major changes in mangrove dynamics. However, other driving forces may be significantly affecting this system. Distinguishing allogenic and autogenic influence on mangroves is a challenging question, because mechanisms related to the natural dynamics of depositional environments (autogenic processes) have strong influences on the establishment and degradation of mangroves. Thus, impacts on mangroves caused by autogenic processes may be erroneously attributed to allogenic mechanisms. Therefore, it is imperative to identify the \u00e2\u0080\u0098fingerprint\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of global changes in modern mangrove dynamics. In order to characterize the influence of these forces on mangroves, this work has used geomorphology and vegetation maps integrated with sedimentological and palynological data, radiocarbon dating, as well as \u00ce\u00b4<sup>13</sup>C, \u00ce\u00b4<sup>15</sup>N and C/N from sedimentary organic matter. The inter-proxy analyses reveal an estuarine influence with mangrove development along the Cear\u00c3\u00a1 Mirim River, north-eastern Brazil, since ~6920 cal yr bp, after the post-glacial sea level rise. Relative sea level (RSL) has been stable during the middle and late Holocene. Mangrove establishment along this fluvial valley begins at about 6920 cal yr bp, caused by the sea-level stabilization, an allogenic influence. However, after its establishment, wetland dynamics were mainly controlled by autogenic factors, related to channel migrations, instead of allogenic process. Some influence of sea-level and climate changes on mangrove dynamics in this estuarine channel have been weakened by more intense tidal channels activities. Therefore, the expansion and contraction of mangrove areas along the estuary of the Cear\u00c3\u00a1 Mirim River since 6920 cal yr bp has been mainly influenced by channel dynamics that regulate the accretion and erosion of mangrove substrates. Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. [7] The importance of mangroves has been well documented in the literature. Of recent interest is the capacity of mangroves to trap atmospheric carbon into their biomass and help mitigate the detrimental impacts of climate change such as tidal surges, sea level rise, coastal erosion, and saltwater intrusion. Mangroves are indeed a unique and productive ecosystem that thrives in the nexus of land and sea. Notwithstanding the small space they occupy, they remain a vital carbon sink because they can accumulate more organic material than other tropical forest types. To ensure the delivery of this important ecosystem service, coastal communities that dwell in proximity to mangroves have significant roles to play. In the Philippines, local communities are lauded stewards of mangrove rehabilitation and protection. This chapter therefore aims to showcase some success stories of community-based mangrove management vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis their potential impacts on carbon stock production. It also highlights current issues and challenges for advancing climate change mitigation through community-based mangrove management. The chapter recommends how such an ecosystem service can be further harnessed to create more benefits that will sustain local commitments on mangrove conservation. [8] The coastal area is absolutely essential for the purposes of resident, recreation, tourism, fisheries and agriculture as a source of socioeconomic development of local community. Some of the activities will affect the coastline changes. Coastline changes may occur due to two main factors include natural factors and also by the factor of human activities in coastal areas. Sea level rise, erosion and sedimentation are among the factors that can contribute to the changes in the coastline naturally, while the reclamation and development in coastal areas are factors of coastline changes due to human activities. Resident area and all activities in coastal areas will provide economic resources to the residents of coastal areas. However, coastline changes occur in the coastal areas will affect socio-economic for local community. A significant effect can be seen through destruction of infrastructure, loss of land, and destroy of crops. Batu Pahat is an area with significant changes of coastline. The changes of coastline from 1985 to 2013 can be determined by using topographical maps in 1985 and satellite images where the changes images are taken in 2011 and 2013 respectively. To identify the changes of risk areas, Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) is used to indicate vulnerability for coastal areas. This change indirectly affects the source of income in their agricultural cash crops such as oil palm and coconut. Their crops destroyed and reduced due to impact of changes in the coastline. Identification of risk coastal areas needs to be done in order for the society and local authorities to be prepared for coastline changes.",

A pilot-scale anaerobic-anoxic-oxic configuration system was used. The system was operated at different mean cell residence times and influent chemical oxygen demand/total phosphorus ratios and with split influent flows. The experimental results confirmed that enhanced biological phosphorus removal could be incorporated successfully into hybrid integrated fixed film activated sludge system, but the redistribution of biomass resulting from the integration of fixed film media and the competition of organic substrate between enhanced biological phosphorus removal and denitrification would affect performances.

Also, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images were employed to specify rate of the biofilm formed on the media inside the reactor IFAS. The best removal efficiency for COD, LAS and oil and grease were respectively obtained as 92.52%, 94.24% and 90.07% in OLR 0.44gCOD/L.d. The assessment of loading rate indicated that with increased OLR to 0.44gCOD/L.d, removal efficiency of COD, oil and grease was increased while with increased OLR, removal efficiency was decreased. In doing so, based on the statistical test ANOVA, such a difference between removal efficiencies in diverse OLRs was significant for COD (p\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a00.003), oil and grease (p\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a00.01).

The SEM images also showed that the biofilm formed on the media inside IFAS reactor plays a considerable role in adsorption and biodegradation of LAS, and oil & grease in greywater. The linear relation between inlet COD values and rate of removed LAS indicated that the ratio of inlet COD (mg/L) to removed LAS (mg/L) was 0.4. Therefore, use of IFAS system for biodegradation of LAS, oil and grease in greywater can be an applicable option.",

In this paper, we propose a novel drought index that accounts for the mutual occurrence of these two conditions by means of a multiplicative approach of a water deficit factor and a dryness probability factor. The former quantifies the actual level of plant water stress, whereas the latter verifies that the current water deficit condition is unusual for the specific site and period. The methodology was tested over Europe between 1995 and 2012 using soil moisture maps simulated by Lisflood, a distributed hydrological precipitation-runoff model. The proposed drought severity index (DSI) demonstrates to be able to detect the main drought events observed over Europe in the last two decades, as well as to provide a reasonable estimation of both extension and magnitude of these events. It also displays an improved adaptability to the range of possible conditions encountered in the experiment as compared with currently available indices based on the sole magnitude or frequency. The results show that, for the analyzed period, the most extended drought events observed over Europe were the ones in Central Europe in 2003 and in southern Europe in 2011/2012, while the events affecting the Iberian Peninsula in 1995 and 2005 and Eastern Europe in 2000 were among the most severe ones. \u00c2\u00a9 2015 European Commission - Joint Research Centre.

For example, oak forests in southern Sweden experienced significant die-offs following the drought of 1992 [5].\n #Reference: [5]: Decline of the oak forests decline in southern Sweden has been reported for more than two decades. Little empirical data exists, however, to study the temporal pattern of the phenomenon in detail. In this study we quantified the temporal pattern of non-windfall oak mortality by analyzing the dataset of 44 dendrochronologically dated dead pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) trees. We compared tree-ring chronologies from recently dead and living trees from the same sites (number of sites=13) located in the nemoral and boreo-nemoral zones in southern Sweden. For each dead tree, tree-ring chronologies were analyzed for the presence of pre-death growth depressions. A growth depression was defined as a period (of one or more years) when growth remained below the 5%, 7%, or 10% quantiles of the ring-width distribution obtained from living trees for a particular year and site. The most recent peak in oak mortality occurred around the year 2000. Growth depressions were recorded in 80% (n=35) of all dead oaks and were most prominent during the 1990s. While some oaks showed an obvious reduction in growth over several decades, 51% of the dead trees had growth depression for at least 4 years prior to death. Although diameter growth rate differed between living and recently dead trees for at least 30 years, this difference started to amplify in late 1980s-early 1990s. Presence of pre-death growth depression in tree-ring chronologies implies that (a) non-windfall mortality of oak is a decade-long process and (b) the actual death events might be lagging behind the timing of the mortality-inducing factors. ANOVA revealed significant differences in tree responses to the drought year 1992. The cumulative growth increment ratio between 1992-1994 and 1989-1991, was higher in living trees than in those that had recently died. We suggest that the spring and summer drought of 1992 resulted in the mortality of oaks that was observed in southern Sweden at the end of the 20th century. If this time lag exists, it may complicate analyses of decline-related factors and the choice of appropriate actions by forest managers. We conclude that studies of oak decline may benefit from widening the time perspective to include several decades preceding the sampling year. \u00c2\u00a9 2006 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.",

This study aims to detect the presence of antibiotic residues, the frequency of antibiotic resistant bacteria and the levels of heavy metals in Benin's waterways. 160 surface water samples from streams in Benin were collected. They were filtered by the membrane filtration method, then incubated on different media. The isolated bacterial species were identified by API 20E gallery and specific biochemical tests. After detection of the resistance profile of the latter, the antibiotic residues were quantified in the samples by the ELISA technique on plate and the physicochemical analyses were performed by Multi 3630 IDS SET KS2 multimeter. Finally, heavy metal levels were detected by the MERCK test kit method specific to each metal. The bacterial species mostly identified were Klebsiella pneumoniae (56.59%), Klebsiella spp. (18.68%), Enterobacter spp. (12.63%).

However, the emergence of new safety concerns (e.g., antibiotic resistance) necessitates an ongoing evaluation of current and future reuse schemes to demonstrate both water security and public safety. This study elucidates the microbial community and antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) profiles of a 100 million gallon per day (MGD) advanced water treatment facility (AWTF). A concurrent evaluation of the groundwater aquifer that is recharged with AWTF product water was also performed to determine the fate of specific microbial targets in the downstream environment. Results indicated that the AWTF reduced nearly all targeted ARGs to below detection limits (<50 copies/L). In groundwater samples, however, a ubiquitous presence of ARGs conferring resistance to sulfonamides (sul1 and sul2) and \u00ce\u00b2-lactams (oxa-1) was observed (10<sup>4</sup>-10<sup>6</sup> copies/L) in both AWTF-recharged locations and control locations. Microbial community analysis via 16S rRNA gene sequencing further showed that the AWTF treatment train effectively excluded any upstream wastewater microbial community characteristics from the product water. Groundwater receiving AWTF recharge through percolation basins was greatly influenced by its proximity to a river that is known to receive conventional wastewater treatment plant effluents.\n[6]: Aquifer recharge presents advantages for integrated water management in the anthropic cycle, namely, advanced treatment of reclaimed water and additional dilution of pollutants due to mixing with natural groundwater. Nevertheless, this practice represents a health and environmental hazard because of the presence of pathogenic microorganisms and chemical contaminants. To assess the quality of water extracted from recharged aquifers, the groundwater recharge systems in Torreele, Belgium, Sabadell, Spain, and Nard\u00c3\u00b2, Italy, were investigated for fecal-contamination indicators, bacterial pathogens, and antibiotic resistance genes over the period of 1 year. Real-time quantitative PCR assays for Helicobacter pylori, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, human pathogens with long-time survival capacity in water, and for the resistance genes ermB, mecA, blaSHV-5, ampC, tetO, and vanA were adapted or devetoped for water samples differing in pollutant content. The resistance genes and pathogen concentrations were determined at five or six sampling points for each recharge system. In drinking and irrigation water, none of the pathogens were detected. tetO and ermB were found frequently in reclaimed water from Sabadell and Nard\u00c7\u0092. mecA was detected only once in reclaimed water from Sabadell. The three aquifer recharge systems demonstrated different capacities for removal of fecal contaminators and antibiotic resistance genes. Ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis in the Torreele plant proved to be very efficient barriers for the elimination of both contaminant types, whereas aquifer passage followed by UV treatment and chlorination at Sabadell and the fractured and permeable aquifer at Nard\u00c3\u00b2 posed only partial barriers for bacterial contaminants.

This paper revised and applied the recently developed urban green network approach to the case of Xi\u00e2\u0080\u0099an city, China, a city which has been rarely studied before from this perspective. The focus was on connecting fragments of urban green\u00e2\u0080\u0093blue spaces to compact green\u00e2\u0080\u0093blue networks, integrating both social and ecological functions into a fully functioning entity. Landscape metric analysis was added to identify that the main city outside the city core should be a planning priority zone. The Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus), Asiatic toad (Bufo gargarizans) and humans at leisure were selected as three focal species to meet the emerged socio-ecological benefits. Sociotope and biotope maps were drawn up to identify patches with high human recreation and wildlife shelter values and providing crucial network structures. Least-cost-path model was used for identifying potential linkages between patches. This model was based on network structures and cost surface, which measures the theoretical energy cost of travelling between landscape elements. By integrating the potential paths for the selected organisms with density analysis, the updated framework generated three improvement maps for species indicators, and 10 network corridors for establishing green\u00e2\u0080\u0093blue networks at city scale.

Serious concerns have, however, been raised concerning the health implications of widespread nanoparticle use and release, deriving largely from the small size, and high reactivity and potential mobility (in both environmental and biological systems) of engineered nanoparticles. There are also serious cost issues related to bulk use of many novel nanomaterials, and questions over the scalability of treatment processes. This chapter discusses current applications of nanotechnology relevant to the treatment of agricultural and food production wastes and effluents, and outlines recent research on nanocomposites and nanostructured materials aimed at producing scalable, low-cost, and nontoxic devices for effluent and water treatment and land remediation and regeneration. Prototype devices based on reactive nanoparticles incorporated into stable polymer, silica, and carbon-based \"scaffolds,\" or on carbons with \"tailored\" nanostructure, show considerable utility in the rapid removal of a range of problem contaminants from water and effluent streams, including problem agricultural pesticides such as metaldehyde, atrazine, and malathion. The use of a flexible (and low-cost) scaffold as a host for the reactive nanoparticles allows the devices to be produced in a range of geometries, which permits their use in a variety of configurations at point of treatment or as decentralized solutions, for example, as a high-throughflow filter for liquids, in a column, membrane or bed reactor, or as permeable reactive barrier materials. The potential advantages of the nanocomposite approach are discussed and evaluated, and the potential for wider application of these and similar devices in effluent, waste and water treatment, and land management, critically evaluated.",

The size of MP is usually < 5 mm. MP are considered as emerging contaminants. This chapter critically analyzes the recent developments on the occurrence and distribution of MP in aquatic and air environments. Extensive use of plastic products and improper management of plastic wastes lead to generation of MP upon exposure to environmental conditions. Environmental fate and transport of MP depend on their physical characteristics (size and density), existing aquatic conditions (water current and turbulence) and prevailing weather conditions (sunlight, rainfall and wind speed). MP exert ecotoxicity to aquatic biota, respiratory ailments upon inhalation of polluted air, and bioaccumulation in the food chain. Potential control strategies for reduction of MP levels in water and air include use of biodegradable plastic products, enhancement of plastic recycling contributing to circular economy, and removal through adsorption. Key knowledge gaps and future research directions are highlighted.\n[6]: Plastics have been the most favorable requirement for the current generation, and it has become an emerging global concern. MPs (Microplastics) have been pervading for 20 years and affecting human health. Recently research related to MPs has catered to solve the hazardous effects growing on the surroundings (Marine life, human health, etc). The current study discovers research areas and themes, followed by the performance indicators (authors, journals contributing to the research related to MPs) to conceptualize the initial and present pavements in MPs by bibliometric analysis. The major research topics seen in 2018\u00e2\u0080\u00932022 in the field of MPs are sampling and association impacts, plastic pollution in micro-nano levels (related to health hazards), and source detection and treatments. The most availed areas were marine, surface water, wastewater, and drinking water followed by very few studies that validated the research in the area of atmospheric MPs. However, the study found that MPs associated with air quality research enticed environmental effects, airborne particle association, transportation and deposition, and atmospheric pollution. The realms of MPs associated with air pollution and air quality are undiscovered to their extent and the research related to the effects on human health remains minimal. The review attempts to explore research based on MPs and provide the overall research themes for researchers to find solutions to the growing issues related to MPs.",

It was found that M. macrocopa was particularly sensitive to those EDCs, especially DEHP and NP. We exposed M. macrocopa to DEHP (0.0012\u00e2\u0080\u00930.1 mg/L) and NP (0.00037\u00e2\u0080\u00930.03 mg/L), and as a result, both chemicals significantly delayed the first day of reproduction. The no observed effect concentrations (NOECs) of DEHP and NP for this endpoint were determined to be 0.0012 and 0.00037 mg/L, respectively, which are far lower than NOECs for any other freshwater species. Existing water quality criteria of various governmental agencies do not consider the toxicity of those EDCs on M. macrocopa, and thus, use of the existing criteria for the risk assessment of the Korean freshwater environment may underestimate the ecological risk. This study recommends using the water quality criteria derived in this study (0.95 \u00ce\u00bcg/L for DEHP and 0.16 \u00ce\u00bcg/L for NP) based on the chronic toxicity data on Korean resident species including M. macrocopa for the aquatic ecological risk assessment in Korea rather than adopting the existing water quality criteria. [12] Synthetic progestins contaminate the aquatic ecosystem, and may cause adverse health effects on aquatic organisms. Megestrol acetate (MTA) is present in the aquatic environment, but its possible effects on fish reproduction are unknown. In the present study, we investigated the endocrine disruption and impact of MTA on fish reproduction. After a pre-exposure period of 14 days, reproductively mature zebrafish (Danio rerio) (F0) were exposed to MTA at environmental concentrations (33, 100, 333, and 666. ng/L) for 21 days. Egg production was decreased in F0 fish exposed to MTA, with a significant decrease at 666. ng/L. The exposure significantly decreased the circulating concentrations of estradiol (E2) and testosterone (T) in female fish or 11-keto testosterone (11-KT) in male fish. MTA exposure significantly downregulated the transcription of certain genes along the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. MTA did not affect early embryonic development or hatching success in the F1 generation. The present study showed that MTA is a potent endocrine disruptor in fish, and short-term exposure to MTA could significantly affect reproduction in fish and negatively impact the fish population. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.",

These chemicals, used in a range of agricultural, industrial, medical, recreational, and residential applications, are termed 'endocrine-disrupting chemicals' (EDCs) due to their hormone-like actions. Species vary in sensitivity to EDCs; often, individuals are exposed to a mixture of EDCs. Exposure during embryonic development appears most deleterious and aquatic species are vulnerable to agricultural runoff. EDCs act directly on steroid receptors, neurotransmitter systems, target organs, and exert toxicological effects, making risk assessment in wildlife challenging.\n[11]: Xenoestrogens are endocrine-disrupting chemicals that mimic the action of endogenous estrogen hormones. Effects of xenoestrogen on aquatic wildlife are well documented, whereas the experimental evidence for impairment of reproductive behavior and physiology in mammals after exposure to xenoestrogens has been debated. The strongest arguments against such studies have been that the route, time course, and intensity of exposure did not simulate environmental exposure and that the chemicals tested have additional nonestrogenic toxic effects, hindering generalization of actual xenoestrogenic effects. Here we show that environmental-like exposure to the pure estrogen 17\u00ce\u00b1- ethinylestradiol during development alters reproductive behavior and physiology in adult female Sprague-Dawley rats. We simulated environmental exposure by giving low doses (0.4 and 0.004 \u00ce\u00bcg/kg\u00c2\u00b7d) of 17\u00ce\u00b1-ethinylestradiol orally to pregnant females from conception to weaning of the pups, which continued to receive the treatment until puberty. We studied the sexual behavior, estrous cycle, and estradiol plasma levels of intact female rats when they reached 3 months of age. Exposure to the higher dose strongly affected female sexual behavior and physiology, with suppression of lordosis and the estrous cycle and enhanced aggression toward males. The lower dose disrupted appetitive components of sexual behavior that influence the rate of copulation. Estradiol plasma levels were not affected by the treatment. Our study revealed that exposure to low oral doses of a pure estrogen during development alters female sexual behavior and physiology. These results suggest potential risks of reproductive failure from xenoestrogen exposure in realistic ecological conditions. Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2008 by The Endocrine Society.",

The intensity and duration of these variations, rather than the mean salinity values ecosystems are exposed to, may be more important in influencing resilience but requires further investigation. Precipitation, including the frequency, intensity and timing of occurrence, is shifting due to climate change. A global analysis on the timing of rainfall in estuarine catchments was conducted. In 80% of the case studies, the maximum daily rainfall occurred in the dry season at least once over the 40-year period and could be classified as an extreme event. We selected an estuary in southwestern Australia and investigated the effects of an extreme rainfall event in 2017 resulting in an excess discharge of freshwater on seagrass Halophila ovalis. Adapting an approach applied for marine heatwaves using salinity data, we quantified metrics and characterised the event along the estuarine gradient. We assessed seagrass resilience by calculating resistance times based on the comparisons of biomass and leaf density data prior to, and during the event, and recovery times through assessment against historical condition. Where salinity is historically more variable, reductions in biomass were lower (higher resistance via plasticity in salinity tolerance) and meadows recovered within 9\u00e2\u0080\u009311\u00c2\u00a0months. Where salinity is historically more stable, loss of biomass was greatest (low resistance) post-event and recovery may exceed 22\u00c2\u00a0months, and potentially due to the rapid decline in salinity (\u00e2\u0088\u00923 PSU/day).

Therefore, the aim of this work was to evaluate the performance of a 445 L packed bed reactor (PBR) operated at different organic loading rates (OLRs between 4 and 12.5 g COD L<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) for the treatment of tequila vinasses. The reactor performance was correlated with the microbial dynamics to elucidate the specific role of the microbial communities in the degradation pathways that govern the process. RESULTS: The PBR was operated for 231 days under different OLRs showing a stable performance. The COD removal and methane yield were maintained throughout the reactor operation at 86\u00e2\u0080\u009389% and 0.24\u00e2\u0080\u00930.28 L CH<inf>4</inf> g<sup>-1</sup> COD<inf>added</inf>, respectively. Meanwhile, the highest volumetric methane production rate of 3.03 L CH<inf>4</inf> d<sup>-1</sup> L<sup>-1</sup> was reached at the highest OLR, 12.5 g COD L<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>. Regarding microbial dynamics, the Bacteria and Archaea populations were able to adapt to the OLR disturbances, favoring the interactions between syntrophic Bacteria and Methanosaeta at high OLRs.

        "input": "#Claim: GWP is a fundamental tool in understanding and managing the impacts of different GHGs on global warming. It provides a standardized way to compare gases and is integral to climate policy and environmental management. However, its application requires careful consideration of time horizons, economic factors, and the specific goals of climate policies [1, 2].\n #Reference: [1]: Purpose: The common practice of summing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and applying global warming potentials (GWPs) to calculate CO<inf>2</inf> equivalents misrepresents the global warming effects of emissions that occur over a product or system's life cycle at a particular time in the future. The two primary purposes of this work are to develop an approach to correct for this distortion that can (1) be feasibly implemented by life cycle assessment and carbon footprint practitioners and (2) results in units of CO<inf>2</inf> equivalent. Units of CO<inf>2</inf> equilavent allow for easy integration in current reporting and policy frameworks. Methods: CO<inf>2</inf> equivalency is typically calculated using GWPs from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. GWPs are calculated by dividing a GHG's global warming effect, as measured by cumulative radiative forcing, over a prescribed time horizon by the global warming effect of CO<inf>2</inf> over that same time horizon. Current methods distort the actual effect of GHG emissions at a particular time in the future by summing emissions released at different times and applying GWPs; modeling them as if they occur at the beginning of the analytical time horizon. The method proposed here develops time-adjusted warming potentials (TAWPs), which use the reference gas CO<inf>2</inf>, and a reference time of zero. Thus, application of TAWPs results in units of CO<inf>2</inf> equivalent today. Results and discussion: A GWP for a given GHG only requires that a practitioner select an analytical time horizon. The TAWP, however, contains an additional independent variable; the year in which an emission occurs. Thus, for each GHG and each analytical time horizon, TAWPs require a simple software tool (TAWPv1.0) or an equation to estimate their value. Application of 100-year TAWPs to a commercial building's life cycle emissions showed a 30 % reduction in CO<inf>2</inf> equivalent compared to typical practice using 100-year GWPs. As the analytical time horizon is extended the effect of emissions timing is less pronounced. For example, at a 500-year analytical time horizon the difference is only 5 %. Conclusions and recommendations: TAWPs are one of many alternatives to traditional accounting methods, and are envisioned to be used as one of multiple characterizations in carbon accounting or life cycle impact assessment methods to assist in interpretation of a study's outcome. \u00c2\u00a9 2012 Springer-Verlag.\n[2]: Energy technologies emitting differing proportions of methane (CH<inf>4</inf>) and carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>) vary significantly in their relative climate impacts over time, due to the distinct atmospheric lifetimes and radiative efficiencies of the two gases. Standard technology comparisons using the global warming potential (GWP) with a fixed time horizon do not account for the timing of emissions in relation to climate policy goals. Here we develop a portfolio optimization model that incorporates changes in technology impacts based on the temporal proximity of emissions to a radiative forcing (RF) stabilization target. An optimal portfolio, maximizing allowed energy consumption while meeting the RF target, is obtained by year-wise minimization of the marginal RF impact in an intended stabilization year. The optimal portfolio calls for using certain higher-CH<inf>4</inf>-emitting technologies prior to an optimal switching year, followed by CH<inf>4</inf>-light technologies as the stabilization year approaches. We apply the model to evaluate transportation technology pairs and find that accounting for dynamic emissions impacts, in place of using the static GWP, can result in CH<inf>4</inf> mitigation timelines and technology transitions that allow for significantly greater energy consumption while meeting a climate policy target. The results can inform the forward-looking evaluation of energy technologies by engineers, private investors, and policy makers.",

In Brazil there is a heated debate over the sustainable approach in SSGM operations, especially in the Amazon biome where biodiversity conservation and indigenous peoples' rights raise global concern. Opposing opinions about what should be \u00e2\u0080\u009csustained\u00e2\u0080\u009d emerge from two extreme perspectives: ensuring the perpetuation of small-scale gold mining to guarantee incomes and productivity, and considering this activity as one of the major threats to Amazonian ecosystems. It is important to understand if, in the Brazilian Amazon, this debate is condemned to remain as \u00e2\u0080\u009cSSGM versus sustainability\u00e2\u0080\u009d or if it could be transformed into \u00e2\u0080\u009cSSGM and sustainability\u00e2\u0080\u009d, meaning that SSGM might embrace an understanding of sustainability that is more balanced between economic and environmental component. Therefore, this study aims at addressing the perceptions of small-scale miners (garimpeiros) themselves regarding sustainability. The research unfolds the dynamic between state impositions of environmental regulations and garimpeiros' response by showing: i) the problematics over environmental licensing and the role of cooperatives in helping with its legal aspects, and generally promoting environmental sustainability; ii) the controversial relationship between garimpeiros and environmental law enforcement agencies; iii) how miners understand the impact of deforestation; and finally, iv) how they explore sustainability pathways with landscape impact-mitigation practices. The results show that garimpeiros\u00e2\u0080\u0099 actions point to the prolongation of their SSGM activity. Nevertheless, it is possible to see seeds of transformation towards more sustainable practices reinforced by associations, the adoption of cleaner technology and initiatives of rehabilitation of mined-out landscapes. Still, SSGM associations mostly employ the notion of sustainability as a palliative to allow their economic growth at the expense of the natural environment. This practice fuels the polarized debate over sustainability in the Amazon and exposes the extreme divergence of positions among all the actors in the arena. Moreover, the notion of sustainability is so malleable that there is a risk that scholars, institutions, and miners might interpret it in different, idiosyncratic ways to serve their particular political values, interests, desires, and visions of the future.",

One of the fundamental tripod of sustainability is keeping the environment safe for the inhabitants. This study, therefore, examines the impact of construction activities on the environment with a view to highlighting mitigation approaches and their enforcement strategies. A quantitative research methodology was adopted, and convenient sampling technique was employed to gather information from primary sources. Questionnaires were administered on construction professionals which include architects, quantity surveyors, engineers, safety officers, as well as construction and facility managers. Construction activities impact badly on the environment due to waste generation, resource consumption, noise pollution, air pollution due to dust from construction activities, as well as bad odours from large diesel-powered vehicles/construction machinery. Although, some of these impacts cannot be completely eradicated, there are a number of approaches that could be used to mitigate them, these include Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), green building (sustainable construction), Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA), Environmental Management System (EMS), and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Therefore, an effort should be made by government and construction stakeholders to efficiently incorporate and enforce the available approaches/initiatives through constant monitoring of construction process from start to completion and legislative laws that spell out punishment as response to violations.

Science provides a range of indicators to monitor and assess CE activities. However, common CE activities, such as recycling and eco-design, are contested in terms of their contribution to environmental sustainability. This article assesses whether and to what extent current approaches to assess CE activities sufficiently capture environmental pressures to monitor progress toward environmental sustainability. Based on a material flow perspective, we show that most indicators do not capture environmental pressures related to the CE activities they address. Many focus on a single CE activity or process, which does not necessarily contribute to increased environmental sustainability overall. Based on these results, we suggest complementing CE management indicators with indicators capturing basic environmental pressures related to the respective CE activity. Given the conceptual linkage between CE activities, resource extraction, and waste flows, we suggest that a resource-based footprint approach accounting for major environmental inputs and outputs is necessary\u00e2\u0080\u0094while not sufficient\u00e2\u0080\u0094to assess the environmental sustainability of CE activities. As footprint approaches can be used across scales, they could aid the challenging process of developing indicators for monitoring progress toward an environmentally sustainable CE at the European, national, and company levels. [9] For a transition toward the circular economy (CE) at the firm level, circular innovations are an essential requirement. Many companies are still hesitant to introduce circular solutions, as their future success chances are difficult to predict. Circular solutions often imply a high uncertainty and complexity because they are designed over multiple life cycles and are strongly interconnected with diverse stakeholders. Therefore, an effective selection process tailored to circular innovation is of great advantage. This study examines circular project selection by investigating selection processes and evaluation criteria for circular innovation management. A qualitative research design was chosen, including 18 in-depth interviews with CE experts and representatives from CE pioneer companies. Findings on the selection process show that circular innovation projects are often embedded in a strategic CE framework decision. Whereas idea generation is usually approached bottom-up involving different stakeholders, project evaluation is rather performed top-down by top management or in cross-functional teams. Furthermore, the study discusses evaluation criteria and their CE implications in detail and structures them into a criteria framework that can be used in multi-criteria decision models. This paper makes a theoretical contribution by connecting innovation and CE literature and by providing new knowledge on the still scarcely explored topic of circular project selection. As practical contribution, the study guides managers on how to approach project selection in circular innovation management and thus supports their development toward a CE.",

In spite of the existence of several such applications, a systematic assessment of the opportunities and limitations of EEIOA to quantify the impacts of circularity strategies is currently missing. This article brings the current state of EEIOA-based studies for assessing circularity interventions up to date and is organised around four categories: residual waste management, closing supply chains, product lifetime extension, and resource efficiency. Our findings show that residual waste management can be modelled by increasing the amount of waste flows absorbed by the waste treatment sector. Closing supply chains can be modelled by adjusting input and output coefficients to reuse and recycling activities and specifying such actions in the EEIOA model if they are not explicitly presented. Product lifetime extension can be modelled by combining an adapted final demand with adjusted input coefficients in production. The impacts of resource efficiency can be modelled by lowering input coefficients for a given output. The major limitation we found was that most EEIOA studies are performed using monetary units, while circularity policies are usually defined in physical units. This problem affects all categories of circularity interventions, but is particularly relevant for residual waste management, due to the disconnect between the monetary and physical value of waste flows. For future research, we therefore suggest the incorporation of physical and hybrid tables in the assessment of circularity interventions when using EEIOA.",

In a monitored site, beaver activity led to increased water storage (approximately 1200 m\u00c2\u00b3 in beaver ponds) and reduced peak and total discharges during storm events by 30% and 34%, respectively. This activity also resulted in lower concentrations of suspended sediment, nitrogen, and phosphate downstream, although it increased dissolved organic carbon concentrations [1].\n #Reference: [1]: Beavers are the archetypal keystone species, which can profoundly alter ecosystem structure and function through their ecosystem engineering activity, most notably the building of dams. This can have a major impact upon water resource management, flow regimes and water quality. Previous research has predominantly focused on the activities of North American beaver (Castor canadensis) located in very different environments, to the intensive lowland agricultural landscapes of the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe. Two Eurasian beavers (Castor fiber) were introduced to a wooded site, situated on a first order tributary, draining from intensively managed grassland. The site was monitored to understand impacts upon water storage, flow regimes and water quality. Results indicated that beaver activity, primarily via the creation of 13 dams, has increased water storage within the site (holding ca. 1000\u00c2\u00a0m<sup>3</sup> in beaver ponds) and beavers were likely to have had a significant flow attenuation impact, as determined from peak discharges (mean 30\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\u00a019% reduction), total discharges (mean 34\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\u00a09% reduction) and peak rainfall to peak discharge lag times (mean 29\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\u00a021% increase) during storm events. Event monitoring of water entering and leaving the site showed lower concentrations of suspended sediment, nitrogen and phosphate leaving the site (e.g. for suspended sediment; average entering site: 112\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\u00a072\u00c2\u00a0mg\u00c2\u00a0l<sup>\u00e2\u0088\u0092\u00c2\u00a01</sup>, average leaving site: 39\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\u00a037\u00c2\u00a0mg\u00c2\u00a0l<sup>\u00e2\u0088\u0092\u00c2\u00a01</sup>). Combined with attenuated flows, this resulted in lower diffuse pollutant loads in water downstream. Conversely, dissolved organic carbon concentrations and loads downstream were higher. These observed changes are argued to be directly attributable to beaver activity at the site which has created a diverse wetland environment, reducing downstream hydrological connectivity. Results have important implications for beaver reintroduction programs which may provide nature based solutions to the catchment-scale water resource management issues that are faced in agricultural landscapes.",

It is gaining traction with policymakers, industry and academia worldwide. It promises to slow, narrow and close socioeconomic material cycles by retaining value as long as possible, thereby minimizing primary resource use, waste and emissions. Herein, we utilize a sociometabolic systems approach to investigate the global economy as embedded into a materially closed \u00e2\u0080\u009cspaceship earth\u00e2\u0080\u009d and to scrutinize the development of circularity during industrialization. We quantify primary material and energy inputs into the economy, as well as all outputs to the environment from 1900-2015. The assessment includes two fundamental cycles: a socioeconomic cycle of secondary materials from end-of-life waste and an ecological cycle in which resulting waste and emissions are assessed against regenerative capacities of biogeochemical systems. In a first approximation, we consider only the carbon-neutral fraction of biomass as renewable. We find that from 1900-2015, socioeconomic and ecological input cycling rates decreased from 43% (41-51%) to 27% (25-30%), while non-circular inputs increased 16-fold and non-circular outputs 10-fold. The contribution of ecological cycling to circularitydeclined from 91% to 76%. We conclude that realizing the transformative potential of the circular economy necessitates addressing four key challenges by research and policy: tackling the growth of material stocks, defining clear criteria for ecological cyclingand eliminating unsustainable biomass production, integrating the decarbonization of the energy system with the circular economy and prioritizing absolute reductions of non-circular flows over maximizing (re)cyclingrates.\n[11]: The circular economy (CE) is an emergent concept to rethink and redesign how our economy works. The concept recognizes effective and efficient economic functioning at multiple scales-governments and individuals, globally and locally; for businesses, large and small. CE represents a systemic shift that builds long-term resilience at multiple levels (macro, meso and micro); generating new business and economic opportunities while providing environmental and societal benefits. Blockchain, an emergent and critical technology, is introduced to the circular economy environment as a potential enabler for many circular economic principles. Blockchain technology supported information systems can improve circular economy performance at multiple levels. Product deletion, a neglected but critical effort in product management and product portfolio management, is utilized as an illustrative business scenario as to blockchain's application in a circular economy research context. Product deletion, unlike product proliferation, has received minimal attention from both academics and practitioners. Product deletion decisions need to be evaluated and analyzed in the circular economy context. CE helps address risk aversion issues in product deletions such as inventory, waste and information management. This paper is the first to conceptualize the relationships amongst blockchain technology, product deletion and the circular economy. Many nuances of relationships are introduced in this study. Future evaluation and critical reflections are also presented with a need for a rigorous and robust research agenda to evaluate the multiple and complex relationships and interplay amongst technology, policy, commerce and the natural environment.",

It represents a new and increasingly popular solution to environmental problems associated with too extensive use of existing natural resources, increasing pollution emission levels and too short product life-cycles. Based on a comprehensive review of the state-of-The-Art research, an integrated circular economy conceptual model applying two basic research perspectives (top-down and bottom-up approaches) was developed. The author emphasizes the need for simultaneous consideration of four main aspects: (1) CE main objectives; (2) key challenges underlying this concept; (3) essential political and social activities, and (4) sustainable practices implemented by companies. The analysis allows to conclude that an effective implementation of the concept of circular economy calls for the consideration of different motivations existing among its stakeholders while economic and social benefits need to be aligned and balanced with ecological benefits.\n[3]: Circular economy, i.e. a closed-loop economy, is an idea in which the value of products and materials is retained as long as possible. A concept that minimizes the environmental impact of the products created, through such choice of components and design that will allow them to be reused. Speaking of circular economy, it is impossible not to mention the role of alternative fuels. According to the EN-15359: 2005 standard - Solid recovered fuels. Specification and classes, alternative fuels are flammable wastes, defragmented, homogeneous mixtures, produced by mixing non-hazardous waste, with or without solid fuel, liquid fuel or biomass, and which, as a result of thermal transformation, do not cause emissions to exceed the limits set out in Ordinance of the Minister of the Environment on the standards of emission from the installations dealing with the process of co-incineration of waste. [3] Development of the alternative fuels market, regardless of technology, should be seen as desirable. The preparation of individual technologies for entering the fuel market is, however, most varied. In addition, a series of studies need be conducted to answer questions on the suitability and potential for using alternative fuels as a source of energy. The article presents the issues of the circular economy package and alternative fuels.\n[12]: The concept of sustainability in the road construction sector is a complex issue because of the various steps that contribute to the production and release of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Addressing this issue, the European Commission has put various policy initiatives in place to encourage the construction industry to adopt circular economy (CE) and industrial symbiosis (IS) principles e.g., the use of recycled materials. Cooperativa Trasporti Imola (CTI), a company located in the Emilia-Romagna region (Italy), has been chosen for the current case study to examine practices, management, and the industrial symbiosis network among various companies in the road construction and rehabilitation sector. In this regard, the use of steel slags, obtained by an electric arc furnace (EAF), and reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP), obtained by the deconstruction and milling of old asphalt pavement have been investigated. Two mixtures of recycled hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) i) were prepared incorporating different recycled material percentages for the wearing and binder course, respectively, ii) were characterized in terms of size distribution, strength modulus and volumetric properties, iii) and finally were compared to the performances of two mixtures entirely designed by virgin materials for the wearing and binder course, respectively. Therefore, the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool was chosen to evaluate the environmental impacts that affect the designed road life cycle. The results show that recycling RAP and EAF slags in a CTI batch plant provides benefits by reducing the consumption of virgin bitumen and aggregates and by reducing CO<inf>2eq</inf> emissions. Finally, practical implications on the use of recycled materials in new asphalt mixtures from a life cycle and industrial symbiosis perspective are provided.",

Besides that, it represents a foundation for the provision of ecosystem services such as clean air and water, valuable timber and animal and plant resources with high commercial and cultural value. However, tropical forests are facing great pressure as a result of increasing human exploitation. If the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tropical forests are destroyed, then many of the biodiversity species will be lost along with them. Not only that, but the local community also loses the natural system that performs valuable services which is important for the continuity of human\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life. The balance of economic growth and conservation of biodiversity and its components including tropical forest must be achieved. Having said this, the ongoing action in conserving our valuable resources of tropical forest is important especially to support the well-being of the local community. Overall, this chapter discusses the importance of tropical forests, threats, conservation action as well as the economic value and economic valuation techniques that can be used to put an economic value on these natural resources.",

They help households understand the importance of waste sorting and the environmental benefits, thereby increasing their participation in recycling programs. Additionally, it is likely that the emotional connection to local environmental issues can further enhance household engagement in waste recovery initiatives [4, 5].\n #Reference: [4]: Sustainability in domestic solid waste management involves waste recovery and households are a major stakeholder in waste management systems. However, the involvement of households in the recovery of waste for recycling, reuse and energy purposes is influenced by a number of levers. In order to achieve sustainable waste recovery systems, it is cardinal to understand the levers that influence households to recover waste from both developing and developed economies. A literature review was conducted to extensively identify and analyze the levers that influence households' participation in waste recovery programs. The results indicate that; social demographic factors, economic incentives, awareness and knowledge on recycling, waste collection systems and other levers influence households to participate in the recovery of waste. The findings from the review may provide vital indicators to authorities in the waste management sector in Zambia and other nations for future implementation and development of solid waste recovery systems at source level in households and at awareness campaigns which publicly recommend the use of these systems.\n[5]: Waste management in Ireland has been dramatically transformed over the past 10 years from over 90% reliance on landfill towards a fully integrated approach. According to the latest EPA National Database Report in 2007 our municipal (household and commercial but excluding construction and demolition) recycling rate was 35% in 2005. This has been achieved through the implementation of 10 regional waste management plans all prepared within a new national planning framework in accordance with the Waste Management Act 1996 and Government policy document 'Changing Our Ways', published in 1998 by the Irish Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The principal drivers of the waste management plans and strategies are the EU Waste Framework Directive (recently revised), the EU Packaging Directive and the EU Landfill Directive. In addition, there were substantial political and environmental drivers due to the relatively poor standard of landfills in Ireland. Strict landfill regulation by the Environment Protection Agency commenced in 1997 and led to many closures of poor facilities and new standards of siting design and operation. This has led to very high landfill charges that are only now beginning to stabilize. The key to improving public attitudes to the greatly improving waste management system has been the degree and content of stakeholder involvement programmes. These programmes are now consolidated into a national 'Race against Waste' programme (www.raceagainstwaste.ie). The purpose of the programme is to create awareness and deal with many of the misconceptions in the public mind attached to waste treatment methods especially incineration. Waste management is after all about people.",

Multivariate statistical analysis allowed the identification of three main factors controlling the distribution of these heavy metals and the other chemical constituents. The extracted factors are as follows: francolite mineral factor, clay minerals factor, and diagenesis factor. Health risk assessments of non-cancerous effects in finer-grained size fraction that might be caused by contamination with the heavy elements have been calculated for both children and adults. The risk assessments in case of children for non-cancerous effects showed that U has values greater than the safe level of hazard index (HI = 1). In case of adults, the value of risk for U is also higher as compared to those of Cd, Ni, Cr, and Zn where it lies within the safe range of hazard index (HI < 1).

The present study aimed the evaluation of the environmental and health impact that would have the reuse of TWW for crops direct irrigation or for the recharge of the local aquifer in Korba (Tunisia). For this purpose water analyses were carried on the TWW intended for the aquifer recharge and on underground water of this area. As for underground water before recharge, no contamination by organic matter or heavy metals is shown but high salinity, nitrate, potassium and chloride concentrations are detected. The bacteriological analyses show the occurrence of faecal streptococcus, thermo-tolerant coliforms, total coliforms and E coli, but absence of salmonella. These results indicate that this water is not suitable for irrigation worse still for drinking purpose. The monitoring of TWW pollutants has demonstrated that oxygen demands (COD and BOD) do not exceed the Tunisian standards for TWW used in agriculture (NT 106.03) except for August when samples reach high values (COD=139 mg O<inf>2</inf>L<sup>-1</sup>, BOD = 34). It is also the case for temperature, electrical conductivity (EC), salinity and pH. Heavy metal concentrations are under the detection limit. The determination of nutrients shows relatively low concentrations of nitrates, nitrites and orthophosphate (the maxima in mg L<sup>-1</sup> are respectively 6.6, 5.6 and 0.92) whereas the potassium levels are high (up to 48.8 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) and the ammonia levels very high, reaching 60.6 mg L<sup>-1</sup>. As for bacteriological pollution, while no salmonella and intestinal nematods are detected, high concentrations of total coliforms, thermo-tolerant coliforms, faecal streptococci and E. coli are analysed. Consequently, the better use of TWW in this region would be the use of infiltration basins for the recharge of the deteriorated aquifer by TWW. It would give the opportunity to better the quality of the TWW reaching the groundwater by an additional treatment for bacteriological and suspended solid (TSS) contaminants while being an alternative water for the aquifer recharge and a coastal barrier against seawater intrusion. \u00c2\u00a9 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Hence, waste management becomes a challenge faced not only by the developing nations, but also the developed and advanced countries. The overall waste management involves three main types of entities: 1) users who generate waste, 2) waste collectors/city admin., 3) stakeholders. Waste management directly effects the lifestyle, healthcare, environment, recycling and disposal, and several other industries. Current waste management trends are not sophisticated enough to achieve a robust and efficient waste management mechanism. It is very important to have a smart way of managing waste, so that not only the waste status is notified in-time when to be collected, but also, all the stakeholders are made aware in timely fashion that what type of waste in what quantity is coming up at what particular time. This will not only help in attracting and identifying stakeholders, but also aids in creating more effective ways of recycling and minimizing waste also making the overall waste management more efficient and environment friendly. Keeping all this in mind, we propose a cloud-based smart waste management mechanism in which the waste bins are equipped with sensors, capable of notifying their waste level status and upload the status to the cloud. The stakeholders are able to access the desired data from the cloud. Moreover, for city administration and waste management, it will be possible to do route optimization and select path for waste collection according to the statuses of waste bins in a metropolis, helping in fuel and time efficiency.",

Luanhe River diversion into Tianjin City in China is an important drinking water resource. Massive growth of a benthic filamentous cyanobacterium with geosmin production in the open canal caused a strong earthy odor episode in Tianjin. On the basis of the morphological and molecular identification of this cyanobacterium as Oscillatoria limosa Agardh ex Gomont, the genetic basis for geosmin biosynthesis and factors influencing growth and geosmin production of O. limosa CHAB 7000 were studied in this work. A 2268-bp open reading frame, encoding 755 amino acids, was amplified and characterized as the geosmin synthase gene (geo), followed by a cyclic nucleotide-binding protein gene (cnb). Phylogenetic analysis implied that the evolution of the geosmin genes in O. limosa CHAB 7000 might involve a horizontal gene transfer event. Examination on the growth and geosmin production of O. limosa CHAB 7000 at different light intensities showed that the maximum geosmin production was observed at 10 \u00ce\u00bcmol photons m <sup>\u00e2\u0088\u00922</sup> s <sup>\u00e2\u0088\u00921</sup> , while the optimum growth was at 60 \u00ce\u00bcmol photons m <sup>\u00e2\u0088\u00922</sup> s <sup>\u00e2\u0088\u00921</sup> .

Results showed that, in the range of test concentration, the adsorption processes followed pseudo-second-order kinetics equation and the modified Freundlich equation in pure water, raw water A and B, and the adsorption rate and adsorption capacity reduced in turn. The adsorption capacity decreased significantly in raw water A and B, but the adsorption potential energies of 2-MIB on activated carbon in raw water B was stronger than that of raw water A, due to the micropore competitive adsorption and polarity caused by the reservoir water of small organic molecules with relative molecular weight of <500 u.\n[12]: Several types of cyanotoxins found in surface water bodies are recognized as having human health effects, whereas taste and odor affect the palatability of water and give rise to public complaints. Conventional water treatment unit operations may be effective in removing the cyanobacteria cells, but cyanotoxins and dissolved organics are not targeted for removal by them. Special treatment units need to be introduced to deal with these substances and attention paid to the process design as many operational issues may be encountered. We used a water supply project in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka as a case study to investigate the performance of unit operations in water treatment plants for which the source is shallow surface water sources with high inflows of nutrients. The present case study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of prechlorination, activated carbon adsorption, dissolved air flotation (DAF), filtration and disinfection in removal of cyanotoxins, and taste and odor causing dissolved organic substances from the source water. Raw water quality was evaluated using algal concentration, algal toxin concentration, and chemical oxygen demand. To evaluate the efficacy of treatment operations, the sequence of initial unit operation was changed on each day as with prechlorination and with powdered activated carbon (PAC), with prechlorination and without PAC, without prechlorination and with PAC, and without prechlorination and without PAC. In addition, laboratory analysis was done to obtain adsorption isotherms using three types of different PAC. The primary findings of our study were that PAC was effective in removal of Microcystin and chemical oxygen demand (COD) but needs to be optimized by providing sufficient contact time, and prechlorination does not improve the performance, whereas postchlorination is effective in removing any traces of Microcystin left after PAC. \u00c2\u00a9 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.",

The current study examines the possibility of blending such fuels into commercial diesel as a drop-in replacement in compression ignition engines as a means of improving particulate emissions on pre-DPF equipped vehicles. Three fuel formulations were created with the first aimed at minimizing the content of polyaromatic hydrocarbons while maximizing the H/C ratio and Lower Heating Value (LHV) in an effort to lower particulate and CO2 emissions. The second variant targeted a minimum viscosity of 1 cSt as a means to address possible fuel viscosity related durability concerns for the fuel injection system. Finally, the third variant was a 50-50 vol% blend of the first and second fuels. A similar cetane number as that found in market available European diesel fuel was targeted for all three fuels. Once the fuels had been prepared, they were tested in a Euro V Volvo MD11 engine recalibrated to reproduce the same NOx-PM trade-off of its Euro II variant. The engine was recalibrated in order to understand the impact of the new fuel formulations on particulate emissions from legacy engines. Euro II homologated engines are present primarily in emerging economies and a drop-in fuel capable of lowering particulate emissions has the potential to improve air quality in these countries without changing the engine calibration. For this reason, the reference diesel fuel was chosen to be representative of the Indian market. The study showed that running these fuels without changing the engine calibration resulted in a decrease in NOx and an increase in PM with no significant variation in engine efficiency. This was due to a change in fuel injection timing that appeared to be caused by the different physical properties of the fuels and their related impact on the hydraulic behavior of the unit injector fuel injection system. When the calibration was adjusted to advance injection timing to compensate for the hydraulic behavior, the three fuels showed much lower PM emissions and CO2 with similar NOx emissions.",

The shift towards lightweight materials in consumer electronics is largely ineffective, suggesting that any benefits are negligible compared to the overwhelming increase in e-waste volume [4].\n #Reference: [4]: The potential for environmental, social, and economic advances enabled by information and communication technologies (ICTs) is tremendous: 'Smart Grid' systems hold promise for resource conservation and climate change mitigation; innovations in ICT help transition countries from industrial to knowledge economies, and bridging the digital divide in developing countries can help achieve Millennium Development Goals worldwide: ending poverty, enabling universal education, and creating global partnerships. However, the benefit possible from global use of ICTs cannot be realized without a corresponding build up of digital infrastructure. This projected increase in ICT products is of particular concern to environmental sustainability, in large part due to the global health, safety, and environmental effects of managing these products in the waste stream. The ability to quantify and manage environmental impacts of ICT products is complicated by continuous evolution of product form and function. The work described herein provides an assessment of how changing form factor and material composition in common consumer electronics - desktop and notebook computers - may influence the electronic waste stream in the U.S. Results indicate that dematerialization on a per product basis is largely offset by increasing volumes of the total waste stream. From an economic standpoint, end-of-life value will be enhanced by the increasing use of lightweight materials such as aluminum and magnesium but potentially impacted by decreasing precious metal content.

        "input": "#Claim: Meaning of Global Warming: Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO\u00e2\u0082\u0082), methane, and nitrous oxides. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, creating a 'greenhouse effect' that leads to warming of the planet [5, 6, 11].\n #Reference: [5] Introduction: Climate change is a change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns when it lasts for an extended period of time. Climate change may refer to a change in average weather conditions, or in the time variation of weather around long-term average conditions. Climate change is caused by factors such as biotic processes, variations in solar radiation received by Earth, plate tectonics, and volcanic eruptions. Certain human activities have also been identified as significant causes of recent climate change, often referred to as global warming. Shifting temperatures are climbing and sea levels are rising. And meanwhile, our planet must still supply us and all living things with air, water, food and safe places to live. If we don't act now, climate change will rapidly alter the lands and waters we all depend upon for survival, leaving our children and grandchildren with a very different world. The most important task of all countries in the face of climate change is to make efforts to reduce climate change and spend more time to anticipate and prevent its risks. The efforts and actions can be done in the current situation are including natural resource conservation, development of green spaces, reduction of power consumption of fossil fuels, saving in consumption, recycling and reduction of waste, sewage treatment, use of renewable energy sources and implementation of appropriate educational programs. The remarkable thing is that these actions by the government alone cannot be done and, thus, all persons in any country should play their role. This requires environmental education in the field of climate change for people to deal with these issues correctly. Thus, in last decade in various countries, study has been done in the field of education to climate change. But reviews of these studies, particularly in Iran, shows that adequate studies have not yet been done to educate climate change in the educational system. Therefore, the purpose of this study is development of the climate change education plan in the formal education system. Materials and methods: Iran formal education system: educational system of Iran is comprised of three sections. These three sections include formal, informal and implicit. In this study, the third grade of the first period of high school is considered as a case study to develop a climate change education plan. Education in the educational process management in the ISO 10015 standard is in four steps; needs assessment, educational designing and planning, implementation, and evaluation. In the Figure (1), the educational process management is represented according to ISO 10015 standard. (Figure Presented) Results and discussion: As mentioned above in this study, climate change education plan for third grade of the first period of high school is developed based on educational process management in the ISO 10015 standard. Education in this system in four steps includes; needs assessment, educational designing and planning, implementation, and evaluation of results. Needs assessment The results show that, the most important educational needs, which are obtained with Fish Bowl technique, as follows are; introduction of basic concepts, current state of climate, climate change causes, effects and impacts, solutions and strategies for prevention, and mitigation and adaptation to climate change (Table 1). (Table Presented) Educational designing and planning Educational designing and planning was done in the five steps, which the goals are: Development thinking about the climate change, increase in student knowledge in this field, training of appropriate personnel to manage climate change. (Table Presented) In the implementation of education, teacher is operator training and the Ministry of Education is in the form of Education Office and schools can support teachers in monitoring the implementation. In the evaluation step, the teacher in addition to the evaluation of classroom sessions should do a final evaluation. Thus, the evaluation should be a combination of formative and final assessment, which recommended the use of goal oriented Tyler pattern. Conclusion: Accurate knowledge about the effects of climate change is essential as a key factor for conscious action and the formation of a person's determination to deal with the effects of climate change. Studies from around the world have observed an unfortunate chain of students not being given an adequate and accurate education on climate change, of teachers not knowing how or what to teach, and of the public that is misinformed about these issues. The structure proposed in this study to climate change education determined the contents that require students to do need assessments. This is based on educational designing and planning. Therefore, the teachers with use of educational designing and planning and on the job training increase their knowledge in this field and it will teach the students. [6] Climate change is nearly irreversible aspect of futuristic progression. Research undertaken globally to understand the implications of greenhouse effect in past few decades suggests that the accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) including major concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) is responsible for global warming and other significant climatic changes. Climate change is responsible for changing weather patterns and the resultant impact in the form of rising surface temperatures, worsening droughts and other forms of natural disasters. The social and economic impacts of increase in frequency of natural disasters are adding to the existing set of challenges that includes distressed population, wretched infrastructure and appalling agricultural and food systems. In addition, climate change impacts are increasingly adding to the risk of Global Food Insecurity that in turn may require early warning systems and effective development programs for increased resilience of urban settlements. United Nations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Report released in 2015 (UN in Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2015) projected the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population count to touch 9.7 billion by the year 2050. With worldwide acceptance for increasing population, changes in climate patterns and urbanization trends are already leading to alarming situations. Referring to basic human needs, food security is under threat due to series of interrelated concerns including but not limited to depleting water aquifers, top soil erosion and increasing urban sprawl on arable land. As much as is the need to provide shelter to increasing population, so is the need to arrange for their nutrition. As the scarcity of land is creating challenge to provide for the essential requirements of humans, therefore, it is desirable to develop innovative, sustainable and integrated solution finding approaches for built environment and farming activities. The focus area is to develop consistent, high-quality production alternatives for farming in built environment, with optimized usage of resources. In the defined scenario, the model of vertical farming has evolved as a multidimensional approach to support urban farming as well as other global challenges, viz. urban heat island effects, carbon emissions, depletion of non-renewable resources and waste management, to name a few. A newer concept in India, but well adopted in countries like Japan, Korea and Netherlands, vertical farming has opened up new avenue to address many challenges through one solution (Maheshwari and Garg in Sustainable Cities: A New Outlook; Reflections from Past to Reinforce the Future. Roorkee, 2015). The Vertical Farm System developed by Dickson Despommier in 1999 was based on conventional techniques of hydroponics and aeroponics to produce farm yields at a consistent rate (Bourne in Nat Geogr 215(6):26\u00e2\u0080\u009359, 2009). The paper intends to review and discuss the impacts of climate change and usefulness of vertical farming as a suitable technique to meet the global food requirements with energy efficiency in indoor environments and suggestive waste management approaches for built environment. [11] Global mean surface temperatures (GMST) exhibited a smaller rate of warming during 1998\u00e2\u0080\u00932013, compared to the warming in the latter half of the 20th Century. Although, not a \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrue\u00e2\u0080\u009d hiatus in the strict definition of the word, this has been termed the \u00e2\u0080\u009cglobal warming hiatus\u00e2\u0080\u009d by IPCC (2013). There have been other periods that have also been defined as the \u00e2\u0080\u009chiatus\u00e2\u0080\u009d depending on the analysis. There are a number of uncertainties and knowledge gaps regarding the \u00e2\u0080\u009chiatus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This report reviews these issues and also posits insights from a collective set of diverse information that helps us understand what we do and do not know. One salient insight is that the GMST phenomenon is a surface characteristic that does not represent a slowdown in warming of the climate system but rather is an energy redistribution within the oceans. Improved understanding of the ocean distribution and redistribution of heat will help better monitor Earth's energy budget and its consequences. A review of recent scientific publications on the \u00e2\u0080\u009chiatus\u00e2\u0080\u009d shows the difficulty and complexities in pinpointing the oceanic sink of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmissing heat\u00e2\u0080\u009d from the atmosphere and the upper layer of the oceans, which defines the \u00e2\u0080\u009chiatus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Advances in \u00e2\u0080\u009chiatus\u00e2\u0080\u009d research and outlooks (recommendations) are given in this report.",

The paper objectives are the development and evaluation of mitigation/adaptation (M/A) policy portfolios and the prioritisation of research needs and gaps.

Our results suggest that incentives to promote the use of energy-efficient appliances can be cost-effective, but whether or not they are depends on the particular country and the options under consideration. From the cases considered, tax credits on boilers appear to be a cost-effective option in Denmark and Italy, while subsidies on CFLi bulbs in France and Poland are cost-effective in terms of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac/ton of CO<inf>2</inf> abated.

Under current conditions, it is important to expand green and open spaces with all their green infrastructure and to optimize land use in terms of quality and quantity. There is a lack of tools for the specific control of urban green infrastructure at plot level. Furthermore, all previous attempts at green space factors (Berlin, Malm\u00c3\u00b6, Seattle, Helsinki, etc.) have primarily focused on ecological factors. Climatic and especially social aspects provided by ecosystem services are largely ignored. It has also been proven that the existing tools do not adequately respond to different building typologies. The purpose of this paper is to present a new calculation method for a Green and Open Space Factor Vienna and to provide greater detail as regards computation, and to compensate for bias in the assessment. The Green and Open Space Factor Vienna considers selected ecosystem services of relevant green and open space elements, comprehensively integrating the ecosystem service approach into urban planning. Applying the new calculation method to the examples shows that this tool is able to capture changes in building mass. If the greening of building sites is relatively equal, the same values can be achieved. If only the building mass and not the proportion of greenery increases, the value of the Green and Open Space Factor Vienna deteriorates. The consideration of climatic, ecological, and above all social aspects in the Green and Open Space Factor Vienna as an urban development index is a promising approach for controlling the supply of green and open spaces, thereby supporting socially sustainable urban development.",

Ecological Modelling and Indicators: Qualitative Network Models (QNMs): These models help predict community-wide responses to changes in aquaculture practices, such as increased bivalve cultivation, and identify key interactions for management intervention [1].\n #Reference: [1]: Predicting the effects of aquaculture development for coastal ecosystems remains challenging, particularly for data-limited systems, and tools that account for complex ecological interactions are needed to support ecosystem approaches to aquaculture. Here, we used qualitative network models (QNMs) to examine the potential community effects of increasing bivalve aquaculture in South Puget Sound, a large estuarine system in Washington, United States. QNMs are formalized conceptual models that require only a qualitative understanding of how variables composing a system interact (that is, the sign of interactions: +,-, and 0) and are therefore well-suited to data-limited systems. Specifically, we examined community-wide responses to scenarios in which bivalve cultivation effort increased for three different bivalve species (Manila clam Venerupis philippinarum, Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, and geoduck Panopea generosa). Further, we evaluated community-wide responses to the removal of benthic bivalve predators, a future increase in nutrient loadings, and combinations of these scenarios acting simultaneously. The scenarios enabled identification of potential trade-offs between increased aquaculture and shifts in the abundance of community members and assessment of the possible effects of different management actions. We also analysed the QNM to identify key interactions that influence the sign outcome of community responses to press perturbations, highlighting potential points for management intervention and linkages deserving of more focused quantitative study. QNMs are mathematically robust and highly flexible, but remain underutilized. We suggest that they may serve as valuable tools for supporting ecosystem approaches to aquaculture.",

Tobacco is a wellknown efficient accumulator of Cd and the genotypic differences in Cd uptake and the response to Cd was not determined. The objectives of this study were to investigate: 1) the effects of Cd on the growth and development of different tobacco cultivars; 2) the differences among tobacco cultivars in Cd concentration, uptake, and use for the phytoremediation of polluted soils with Cd; and (3) the interactions between Cd and Zn with respect to concentration and uptake. The Cd level affected the number of leaves and dry matter accumulation, and there were differences among the different cultivars that were used. Furthermore, some cultivars showed a higher reduction in growth than others, indicating that they are more sensitive to Cd level in the soil. Moreover, differences existed among the cultivars for the Cd concentration and uptake. There also were negative correlations between Cd and Zn concentrations; as Cd accumulation increased, Zn accumulation decreased, which showed that the two heavy metals were antagonistic. These results suggest that tobacco cultivars differed greatly in their growth and developmental responses to Cd and in the concentration and uptake of Cd and Zn. In addition, it is possible to use certain tobacco cultivars to lower the Cd concentration in the soil. Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

These traits are often used in conjunction with molecular markers to provide a comprehensive understanding of genetic diversity and relationships [4, 5, 6].\n #Reference: [4]: Modern watermelon cultivars (Citrullus lanatus [Thunb.] Matsum.& Nakai var. lanatus) have fruits with diverse phenotypes, including fruit shape, rind patterns, and flesh color. Molecular markers enable efficient selection of plants harboring desirable phenotypes. In the present study, publicly available DNA markers tightly linked to fruit shape, rind stripe pattern, and flesh color were evaluated using 85 watermelon accessions with diverse fruit phenotypes. For fruit shape, the dCAPS SUN - Cla011257 marker revealed an 81% of marker - trait match for accessions with elongated or round fruits. For rind stripe pattern, the SCAR wsb6-11marker was effective for selecting Jubilee-type rind pattern from other rind patterns. For flesh color, the Clcyb.600 and Lcyb markers derived from a mutation in the Lycopene \u00ce\u00b2 - cyclase (Lcyb) gene, were effective at selecting red or yellow flesh. Forty-eight accessions possessing diverse fruit - related traits were selected as a reference array and their genetic relationships assessed using 16 SSR markers. At a coefficient of 0.11, the 48 accessions grouped into two major clades: Clade I and Clade II. Clade I subdivided further into subclades I - 1 and I - 2 at a coefficient of 0.39. All accessions with colored flesh were classified into Clade I, whereas those with white - flesh were classified into Clade II. Differences in fruit traits between subclades I - 1 and I - 2 were observed for rind pattern and fruit color; a majority of the accessions with Crimson-type striped or non-striped rind were grouped together in subclade I - 1, while most accessions in subclade I - 2 had a Jubilee - type rind stripe pattern. These results imply that reference array watermelon accessions possess distinguishable genetic structure based on rind stripe pattern. However, no significant grouping pattern was observed based on other fruit-related traits.\n[5]: In the present study genetic diversity among 48 muskmelon accessions was analyzed employing various morphological traits under well-watered and water-deficit condition and SSR markers. Maximum values for horticultural traits were, 44 cm for fruit polar circumference, 33.2 cm for fruit equatorial circumference, 21 for number of fruits, 41.5 for days to first male flowering, 44 for days to 50% male flowering, 44 days to first female flowering, 45 days to 50% female flowering and 5.66 for number of shoot branching under well-watered condition. While under water-deficit condition maximum values of same parameters were 28.8 cm, 26 cm, 18, 37.2, 39, 47, 46.2 and 4.4, respectively. Based on morphological traits genotypes were clustered in three major clusters under well-watered condition, while grouped in five major clusters under water-deficit condition. Out of the 52 SSR markers, 35 produced polymorphic patterns, a total of 125 amplification products were obtained, the mean number of alleles per locus was 3.57, and the size of amplified products ranged from 120 bp to 605 bp. The average PIC value was estimated to be 0.492. Jaccard similarity coefficients calculated from SSR data varied from 0.03 to 0.89 with a mean value of 0.46. The clustering pattern of muskmelon accessions based on SSR markers was random but not in consonance with the groupings based on quantitative traits under well-watered and water-deficit condition. High genetic variability was observed based on various morphological traits, under both well-watered and water-deficit condition and SSR markers, indicating genetically diverse accessions.\n[6]: We present here the first comprehensive genetic characterization of wild melon accessions from northern India. The genetic diversity among 43 wild melon accessions collected from the six agro-ecological regions of the Punjab State of India was assessed by measuring variation at 16 Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) loci, morphological traits of plant habit and fruit morphological traits, two yield-associated traits, root nematode resistance and biochemical composition (ascorbic acid, carotenoids, titrable acidity). Variation among accessions was observed in plant habit and fruit traits and wild melon germplasm with high acidity and elevated carotenoid content and possessing resistance to Meloidogyne incognita was identified in the collection. A high level of genetic variability in wild melon germplasm was suggested by SSR analysis. Comparative analysis using SSRs of the genetic variability between wild melons from the north and other melons from the south and east regions of India and also reference accessions of cultivated melon from Spain, Japan, Korea, Maldives, Iraq and Israel, showed regional differentiation among Indian melon accessions and that Indian germplasm was not closely related to melon accessions from other parts of the world.

For instance, in regions like Nyuh Kuning, economic pressures lead to the conversion of agricultural land for more profitable uses, reducing the emphasis on traditional and organic farming practices [4].\n #Reference: [4]: Natural landscape in developing countries is facing a challenge due to economic growth, a cultural shift, and population dynamics. Farm land where is close to urban areas tending to be converted into more economically valuable spaces. Watershed Pakerisan listed as World Heritage of UNESCO, rich of cultural value on its landscape, especially the Subak, a traditional irrigation system, has a close relationship to the philosophy of Hindu-Bali culture. Nyuh Kuning, a village (local terms is Banjar) located adjacent to the Pakerisan Watershed, and has a spatial pattern in synergic ally connected with tradition, culture, and their religion. Rice field not only for economical but also its place to worship the Goddess (Dewi Sri). Rice Field in Nyuh Kuning declined significantly along past 10 years. The changing landscape of Nyuh Kuning traced through serial of aerial photographs from 2005 until 2015. Along with the broad decline of rice field, villager's attachment on their cultural space is also changing. An economic motive pronounces a winner in the bargaining between the motives of economic value and cultural value in the Nyuh Kuning. Villagers revealed arguments that necessities nowadays prosecute high consumption, both for household and for education. Therefore conversion of rice fields to become more economical is understandable among communities. Villagers rent the rice fields to foreigners (migrants), and then foreigners take rice-fields as personal assets, not for the villagers (ritual activities and the cultural traditions) any longer. In theoritical term, villager's emotional bond to the cultural landscape in post - productivism of rice field, is weakened. Wawedangan Desa and its complex cultural values are not part of their identity anymore. However, place dependence become the reason why the shifting place attachment is happening. Functional economic bond is mentioned as place dependence dominats in villager's attachment. Certainly it's not a sustainable way in conserving cultural landscape. Learning from Nyuh Kuning case, new ideas need to conserve cultural landscape and at the same time increased the economic villagers. Through considering rice fields renters preferences and attachment land in Nyuh Kuning, rice field is an important element for their preferences to stay at Nyuh Kuning. Villas in Nyuh Kuning retaining rice field map as part of the villa's character.

Fish Ladders and Migration: Fish ladders are designed to reestablish connectivity for migratory species, but their effectiveness can be limited if they do not facilitate both upward and downward movements [2].\n #Reference: [2]: Fish ladders are generally conceived to reestablish connectivity among critical habitats for migratory species, thus mitigating the impacts of the blockage of migration routes by dams. If this management tool is to be meaningful for conserving fish species, it must provide a fully permeable connection and assure both upward and downward movements. However, because reservoirs have very different hydrodynamics than the original river, it is expected that, at least in the inner area, they may constitute an additional barrier to this movement, especially for descending fish. Thus, the present study sought to determine if migratory fish and their offspring disperse downstream from the dam after ascending a ladder and spawning in the upper reaches of a basin. To achieve this purpose, we evaluated the limitation imposed by lentic areas to the descent of eggs, larvae and adults of migratory species; we also determined the abundance and composition of larvae present in the plankton near the dam, and compared the intensity of the upward and downward movements of adult fish. Samples of ichthyoplankton were taken upriver, inside the reservoir, in the river downstream from the dam, and in the forebay of the Lajeado Dam on the Tocantins River (Luis Eduardo Magalh\u00c3\u00a3es Hydroelectric Plant), from October, 1999 through September, 2004. The densities of fish ascending and descending the ladder were determined experimentally on eight occasions, from June, 2004 to March, 2005. Due to difficulties in identifying the true fish origin (up or down) in the environments connected by the fish passage system, the evaluation of the distribution of migratory fish in reservoirs was based on the landings of the commercial fishery conducted along the Itaipu Reservoir during the four years preceding (2001 through 2003) the construction of the lateral channel (fish-passage mechanism). Fish eggs and larvae drifting down the Tocantins River did not appear in samples taken in the lower half of the reservoir; those found in water flowing through the spillways, turbines or fish ladder of Lajeado Dam belonged essentially to non-migratory clupeids that spawn in the inner part of the reservoir. In addition, results showed that in a reservoir with no fish-passage mechanism, migrants select habitats that still maintain riverine characteristics, in the upper parts of the impounded area. The downward movements are negligible compared to those upward, in the experiments conducted in the fish ladder. It is concluded, therefore, that the Lajeado fish ladder, and possibly those at other dams, is essentially a one-way route that promotes upstream movements of migrants, without the necessary return of adults or their offspring. Thus, the low permeability of the connections provided by these management tools can drastically increase the level of environmental impact that they were actually intended to reduce.

The cohesion-tension theory is the most accepted to explain this process, which is complemented by the Ohm's law analogy, which analyzes the flow of water as a catenary process. Resistance to water stress and cavitation is strongly associated with the anatomical characteristics of the xylem, the intervessel pits, and their membranes, the latter being altered depending on the chemical properties of the aqueous solution that flows through them. Based on these premises, this review addresses the phenomenon of ascent of water in terrestrial vascular plants and analyzes the concepts, theories, and methods most used in the study of hydraulic architecture. In addition, it points out the differences in xylem structure and water transport between dicots and monocots.\n[6]: Stomatal regulation of transpiration constrains leaf water potential (\u00ce\u00a8<inf>L</inf>) within species-specific ranges that presumably avoid excessive tension and embolism in the stem xylem upstream. However, the hydraulic resistance of leaves can be highly variable over short time scales, uncoupling tension in the xylem of leaves from that in the stems to which they are attached. We evaluated a suite of leaf and stem functional traits governing water relations in individuals of 11 lowland tropical forest tree species to determine the manner in which the traits were coordinated with stem xylem vulnerability to embolism. Stomatal regulation of \u00ce\u00a8<inf>L</inf> was associated with minimum values of water potential in branches (\u00ce\u00a8<inf>br</inf>) whose functional significance was similar across species. Minimum values of \u00ce\u00a8<inf>br</inf> coincided with the bulk sapwood tissue osmotic potential at zero turgor derived from pressure-volume curves and with the transition from a linear to exponential increase in xylem embolism with increasing sapwood water deficits. Branch xylem pressure corresponding to 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity (P <inf>50</inf>) declined linearly with daily minimum \u00ce\u00a8<inf>br</inf> in a manner that caused the difference between \u00ce\u00a8<inf>br</inf> and P <inf>50</inf> to increase from 0.4 MPa in the species with the least negative \u00ce\u00a8<inf>br</inf> to 1.2 MPa in the species with the most negative \u00ce\u00a8<inf>br</inf>. Both branch P <inf>50</inf> and minimum \u00ce\u00a8<inf>br</inf> increased linearly with sapwood capacitance (C) such that the difference between \u00ce\u00a8<inf>br</inf> and P <inf>50</inf>, an estimate of the safety margin for avoiding runaway embolism, decreased with increasing sapwood C. The results implied a trade-off between maximizing water transport and minimizing the risk of xylem embolism, suggesting a prominent role for the buffering effect of C in preserving the integrity of xylem water transport. At the whole-tree level, discharge and recharge of internal C appeared to generate variations in apparent leaf-specific conductance to which stomata respond dynamically. \u00c2\u00a9 2008 Springer-Verlag.",

Variation in stomatal control has been reported among lineages of vascular plants, thus giving rise to the possibility that different lineages may show distinct WUE dynamics in response to water stress. Here, we compared the response of gas exchange to decreasing leaf water potential among four ferns and nine seed plant species exposed to a gradually intensifying water deficit. The data collected were combined with those from 339 phylogenetically diverse species obtained from previous studies. In well-watered angiosperms, the maximum stomatal conductance was high and greater than that required for maximum WUE, but drought stress caused a rapid reduction in stomatal conductance and an increase in WUE in response to elevated concentrations of abscisic acid. However, in ferns, stomata did not open beyond the optimum point corresponding to maximum WUE and actually exhibited a steady WUE in response to dehydration. Thus, seed plants showed improved photosynthetic WUE under water stress. The ability of seed plants to increase WUE could provide them with an advantage over ferns under drought conditions, thereby presumably increasing their fitness under selection pressure by drought. [16] An adequate general drought tolerance and the ability to acclimate to changing hydraulic conditions are important features for long-lived woody plants. In this study, we compared hydraulic safety (water potential at 50% loss of conductivity, \u00ce\u00a850), hydraulic efficiency (specific conductivity, ks), xylem anatomy (mean tracheid diameter, dmean, mean hydraulic diameter, dh, conduit wall thickness, t, conduit wall reinforcement, (t/b)h<sup>2</sup>) and stomatal conductance, gs, of forest plants as well as irrigated and drought-treated garden plants of Ligustrum vulgare L. and Viburnum lantana L. Forest plants of L. vulgare and V. lantana were significantly less resistant to drought-induced cavitation (\u00ce\u00a850 at -2.82 \u00c2\u00b1 0.13 MPa and -2.79 \u00c2\u00b1 0.17 MPa) than drought-treated garden plants (- 4.58 \u00c2\u00b1 0.26 MPa and -3.57 \u00c2\u00b1 0.15 MPa). When previously irrigated garden plants were subjected to drought, a significant decrease in dmean and dh and an increase in t and (t/b)h<sup>2</sup> were observed in L. vulgare. In contrast, in V. lantana conduit diameters increased significantly but no change in t and (t/b)h <sup>2</sup> was found. Stomatal closure occurred at similar water potentials (\u00ce\u00a8sc) in forest plants and drought-treated garden plants, leading to higher safety margins (\u00ce\u00a8sc - \u00ce\u00a850) of the latter (L. vulgare 1.63 MPa and V. lantana 0.43 MPa). These plants also showed higher gs at moderate \u00ce\u00a8, more abrupt stomatal closure and lower cuticular conductivity. Data indicate that the development of drought-tolerant xylem as well as stomatal regulation play an important role in drought acclimation, whereby structural and physiological responses to drought are species-specific and depend on the plant's hydraulic strategy. [19] Ecosystem conductance, which describes ecosystem regulation of water and carbon exchange and links plant functions with the environment, is a critical component in ecosystem and earth system models. However, the behaviors of ecosystem conductance at the ecosystem level and its responses to environmental conditions are still largely unclear. In this study, half-hourly data of 77 eddy-covariance sites from the FLUXNET2015 dataset were used to compare four ecosystem conductance models at the ecosystem level and determine the most consistent vapor pressure deficit (VPD) dependence across plant functional types for varying soil moisture stress levels at the subdaily time scale. We used leaf-level VPD (VPD<inf>l</inf>), a better indicator of atmospheric dryness at the leaf level, for canopy-level analysis instead of measured atmospheric VPD. Detection of the best-fitted exponent of VPD<inf>l</inf> indicates that ecosystem conductance responds to VPD between optimality-theory (i.e., VPD<sup>\u00e2\u0088\u00920.5</sup> dependence) and Leuning's (i.e., VPD<sup>\u00e2\u0088\u00921</sup> dependence) models. Accounting for different soil moisture stress levels only affected minimum ecosystem conductance and did not affect the exponent and factor of VPD<inf>l</inf>, indicating limited diurnal soil moisture-VPD<inf>l</inf> interactions. These results indicate limited interaction between xylem and stomata at subdaily time scales and that soil moisture effects can be simplified as a regulation of minimum (soil plus canopy) conductance.",

        "input": "#Claim: Stomatal regulation and hydraulic adjustments are the sole mechanisms by which plants maintain water balance and avoid excessive water loss during drought, as other factors are negligible in comparison [9, 10].\n #Reference: [9]: Stomata rapidly and slowly respond to a range of abiotic stress, regulating water status. Under water-sufficient conditions, the majority of water loss in plants occurs through open stomata. Under environmental conditions that cause stomata to close, such as during drought, water loss is mainly executed via solid-phase cuticular transpiration. The diffusional resistance of the transpiration pathway consists of two varying components: the leaf stomatal resistance and the leaf boundary layer resistance. Dehydration avoidance mechanisms involve the maintenance of a high (favorable) plant water status during stress. Many cacti, orchids, bromeliads, and other succulent plants with crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) have stomatal activity patterns that contrast with those found in C3 and C4 plants. Tolerance to low water potentials requires maintaining plant functions under limited water availability and/or the rapid recovery of plant water status and plant function after stress.\n[10]: Stomata control tree transpiration by sensing and integrating environmental signals originating in the atmosphere and soil, and co-occurring species may differ in inherent stomatal sensitivity to these above-and belowground signals and in the types of signals to which they respond. Stomatal responsiveness to environmental signals is likely to differ across species having different types of wood (e.g., ring-porous, diffuse-porous and coniferous) because each wood type differs in the structure, size and spatial distribution of its xylem conduits as well as in the scaling of hydraulic properties with stem diameter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of variation in soil water availability and atmospheric evaporative demand on stomatal regulation of transpiration in seven co-occurring temperate deciduous forest species representing three wood types. We measured whole-tree sap flux and soil and atmospheric variables in a mixed deciduous forest in central Pennsylvania over the course of a growing season characterized by severe drought and large fluctuations in atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (D). The relative sensitivity of sap flux to soil drying was \u00e2\u0088\u00bc2.2-2.3 times greater in the diffuse-porous and coniferous species than in the ring-porous species. Stomata of the ring-porous oaks were only about half as responsive to increased D as those of trees of the other two wood types. These differences in responsiveness to changes in the below-and aboveground environment implied that regulation of leaf water potential in the ring-porous oaks was less stringent than that in the diffuse-porous angiosperms or the conifers. The results suggest that increases in the frequency or intensity of summer droughts in the study region could have multiple consequences for forest function, including altered successional time courses or climax species composition and cumulative effects on whole-tree architecture, resulting in a structural and physiological legacy that would restrict the ability of trees to respond rapidly to more favorable growth conditions. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 The Author.",

Familiarity among conspecifics can increase aggression and stress, resulting in poorer growth outcomes [1].\n #Reference: [1]: The deleterious effect of competition for space and food in animals increases with increasing population density. In contrast, familiarity towards conspecifics can relax the intensity of interference competition. Here, we hypothesized that familiarity towards conspecifics mitigates the effect of density-dependent growth and dispersal behaviour in territorial animals. To test this, wild-captured juvenile brown trout were subjected to two consecutive laboratory experiments. First, growth and fin erosion were measured for 40\u00c2\u00a0d in a 2\u00c2\u00a0\u00c3\u0097\u00c2\u00a02 factorial design manipulating density and familiarity. The density was manipulated via size of experimental tanks, while per capita food abundance and fish number was constant. All fish were subsequently exposed to an emergence test, giving them the option to leave their group and disperse to a novel unoccupied environment. The results show that familiarity increases growth and decreases the level of fin erosion (i.e. proxy of intensity of aggressive interactions). We found no significant effect of population density on growth rate. However, there was a tendency towards higher fin erosion in fish kept under high density. The growth of individuals was also affected by their size rank within the group, with the largest individuals in each group growing disproportionally faster than the rest of the group, probably due to their high social rank. However, the second and third fish in the size rank did not grow significantly faster and tended to suffer higher mortality than the rest of the group. During the emergence test, the largest individuals in the familiar groups left the shelter either as the first (six of 12 groups) or last (five of 12 groups) individual in the group, while no such pattern was observed in unfamiliar groups. Our results suggest that individuals in familiar groups receive less aggression and stress (i.e. fin damage) and grow faster than fish in unfamiliar groups. The mechanisms indicated in this laboratory study may be especially important in highly fecund organisms like fish which undergo density-dependent bottlenecks during early life.",

We studied how aggressive propensity influences dominance, contest behaviour and growth in the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher. We tested whether intrinsic aggressive propensity (1) influences dominance in paired contests, (2) causes different aggression levels in contests with partners matched for aggressive propensity compared to unmatched partners, and how it (3) affects growth rate in groups that were either matched or unmatched for aggressive propensity. Intrinsic aggressive propensity was first scored with a mirror test and classified as high, medium or low. Thereafter we tested fish with either high or low aggressive propensity with partners matched for size and either matched or unmatched for aggressive type in a paired contest for a shelter. We scored dominance, aggression and submission. As predicted, (1) dominance was more clearly established in unmatched than in matched contests and (2) individuals with high aggressive propensity launched more attacks overall than fish with low intrinsic aggressiveness, suggesting a higher propensity to escalate independently of winning or losing the paired contest. However, contrary to expectation, (3) individuals with low aggressiveness grew faster than aggressive ones in unmatched groups, whereas the opposite occurred in matched groups. This suggests that individuals with low aggressive propensity may benefit from conflict evasion, which might allow them to gain dominance in the future owing to larger body size. \u00c2\u00a9 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",

Early emerging rainbow trout, which exhibit proactive behavioral traits including higher aggression, showed higher routine metabolic rates and greater weight loss during fasting, suggesting that aggressive behavior can lead to higher energy expenditure [4].\n #Reference: [4]: The timing with which salmonid larvae emerge from their gravel nests is thought to be correlated with a particular suite of behavioural and physiological traits that correspond to the stress coping style of the individual. Among these traits, aggressiveness, dominance and resilience to stress, are potentially interesting to exploit in aquaculture production. In the present study a series of experiments were performed, with the purpose of characterising behavioural, metabolic and production related traits in rainbow trout juveniles from different emergence fractions. Newly hatched rainbow trout were sorted according to their emergence time from an artificial redd. The early, middle, and late fractions were retained and assessed for their physiological response to stress, growth performance, metabolism, fasting tolerance, and potential for compensatory growth. The early emerging fraction showed proactive behavioural traits; they were faster to reappear following startling, showed a reduced cortisol response following stress, and a reduced metabolic cost of recovery. Emergence time was not correlated with any differences in standard or maximum metabolic rates, but was however, correlated with higher routine metabolic rates, as demonstrated by significantly bigger weight losses during fasting in the early emerging group. Growth rates and feed conversion efficiencies were not significantly different when fish were co-habitated under a restrictive feeding regime, suggesting that early emerging fish are not able to monopolise food resources. The intermediate emerging group, which makes up the bulk of a population and is often ignored, appears to possess the best growth performance traits, possibly because they do not expend excessive energy on dominance behaviour such as the early emerging group, while they are also not overly timid or stress prone such as the late emerging group.",

Fish raised in social isolation exhibited normal physiological rates and timely behavioral responses, suggesting that the social environment has little impact on physiological development [5].\n #Reference: [5]: Interactions between conspecifics during embryonic development have the potential to influence phenotypic traits of individuals, with social interaction being particularly important for the realisation of normal behaviours. Here, the effect of increasing numbers of conspecifics (from isolation to groups of 20, 50, 100 and 200) on the physiology and behaviour of developing trout was investigated with the hypothesis that a) conspecific presence would alter physiological processes and b) that development in the absence of conspecifics would affect subsequent behavioural performance. During development, mass, oxygen consumption, sodium uptake and ammonia excretion rates were measured at a variety of time points from fertilisation to after hatching. After first feeding, behaviour of individuals raised in social isolation was compared to behaviour of juvenile fish raised in social groups. Embryos and larvae raised in social isolation had lower oxygen consumption rates, lower sodium uptake rates and higher ammonia excretion rates compared to those raised in groups. Social isolation delayed the response of a juvenile fish to its own mirror image but did not affect the probability of it winning a paired encounter with an individual raised in a social environment.

For example, the avivorous bat Ia io exhibited dietary niche shifts towards birds, resulting in a narrower population dietary niche breadth due to reduced dietary diversity [1]. This suggests that seasonal resource availability can drive specialization in dietary habits.\n #Reference: [1]: The variation in niche breadth can affect how species respond to environmental and resource changes.

Optimal foraging theory (OFT) and the niche variation hypothesis (NVH) predict that when food resources are limited, the population niche breadth will widen or narrow due to increased within-individual dietary diversity and individual specialization or reduced within-individual dietary diversity, respectively. Here, we used DNA metabarcoding to examine the composition and seasonality of diets of the avivorous bat Ia io. Furthermore, we investigated how the dietary niches changed among seasons and how the population niche breadth changed when the availability of insect resources was reduced in autumn. We found that there was differentiation in dietary niches among seasons and a low degree of overlap, and the decrease of insect resource availability and the emergence of ecological opportunities of nocturnal migratory birds might drive dietary niche shifts toward birds in I. io. However, the population\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s dietary niche breadth did not broaden by increasing the within-individual dietary diversity or individual specialization, but rather became narrower by reducing dietary diversity via predation on bird resources that served as an ecological opportunity when insect resources were scarce in autumn. Our findings were consistent with the predictions of OFT, because birds as prey for bats provided extremely different resources from those of insects in size and nutritional value.

Phenotypic variations among individuals can generate intrapopulation differences in trophic resource use, which could have important ecological and evolutionary implications in amphibian populations. Here, we studied the intrapopulation dietary variation of the frog Pseudopaludicola pusilla in an anthropic savanna of the Colombian Caribbean region, considering the effects of seasonality and sex on the size, amount, prey composition and dietary individual specialization. We collected 44 adult frogs during the dry season and 46 during the rainy season and analyzed their stomach contents to determine their dietary composition. Our results indicate that P. pusilla is a generalist and opportunist predator, feeding mainly on insects of the orders Orthoptera, Coleoptera and Hymenoptera, which were the most important prey categories due to their numeric, volumetric and frequency contributions. We observed seasonal variations regarding volumetric prey composition and the importance value of each prey category in the populational diet. Individuals of P. pusilla consume more prey items during the rainy season and bigger prey during the dry season, but the volume of stomach contents did not vary seasonally. Males and females of P. pusilla consumed a similar number of prey items, but females ingested more voluminous prey and had greater volumes of stomach contents than males. Additionally, we observed a pattern of dietary individual specialization, which was not related to morphological trade-offs and did not differ among seasons.

We studied the longest single flight, total distance flown, and the number of flights initiated by wild Cactoblastis cactorum (Berg) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) to determine whether the flight performance of overwintered cactus moths with a prolonged feeding phase during development differs from nonoverwintered cactus moths. Pupae of field-collected and laboratory-reared moths were transported together from the United States to Switzerland, and flight mills were used to characterize the flight capacity of 24-to 48-h-old adults during their most active period of the diel cycle. The lack of seasonal variation in flight performance of those moths that developed under controlled environment but were fed with field-collected Opuntia cacti showed that seasonal changes in host plant quality did not affect flight. This consistent flight performance in the mass-reared laboratory population throughout the year is beneficial for sterile insect technique programs, which aim to limit the dispersal of this pest. For field-collected C. cactorum, the larger overwintered females performed similarly to nonoverwintered females, indicating that longer feeding time at lower temperature increases body size but does not influence female flight capacity. Young mated females had a similar flight capacity to unmated ones, suggesting that gravid females may play an important role in invading new habitats.

Release profiles of the CMC/Alg NPK conformed to the standards of controlled-release fertilizer with a maximum release rate of 50% for CMC/Alg NPK in 30 d. Investigation of the release mechanism using the Korsmeyer-Peppas mathematical model showed that the release of nutrients is governed by both coating material relaxation and diffusion processes. Controlled release behavior was demonstrated as confirmed in the efficacy evaluation of the prepared fertilizer in a 2-mo pot experiment using mung bean.\n[4]: NPK nanofertilizer was prepared by loading nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and potassium (K) into chitosan nanoparticles. The chitosan nanoparticles were prepared via ionic gelation of tripolyphosphate and chitosan solution. The chitosan nanoparticles were characterized by SEM, TEM, zeta potential and size distribution. The results showed that size distribution was from 300 to 750\u00c2\u00a0nm and zeta potential of around 50\u00c2\u00a0mV. The released kinetics of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium in nanofertilizer were also investigated for 240\u00c2\u00a0h. The nanofertilizer was applied to coffee seedlings in a greenhouse condition. The results showed that the nanofertilizer enhanced uptake of nutrients, photosynthesis and growth of coffee plants. Application of the nanofertilizer improved 17.04% nitrogen, 16.31% phosphorous and 67.50% potassium content in the leaves of treated plots compared to the control; total chlorophyll content increased up to 30.68% and 71.7% of photosynthesis net rate. Application of nanofertilizer also enhanced leaf number, plant height and leaf area of the coffee seedlings. Using the nanofertilizer may be a potential way to enhance use efficiency of fertilizers for coffee.",

WWM has higher damaged starch and ash content. Unlike wheat flour, WWM contains the some amount of bran. This is due to during the milling process of WWM; larger bran particles are preferably sifted out, leaving smaller bran particles. Chemical and microstructure changes occurring during processing of wheat into WWM were evaluated by analyzing mill stream (C4, C5 and WWM) samples from a pilot mill. The ash content was 0.43%, 0.90% and 0.75%; while damaged starch content was 8.30%, 10.70% and 10.31% in C4, C5 and WWM streams, respectively. Ash and damaged starch contents were higher in C5 stream as compared to the C4 stream. However, both these parameters were lower in the case of WWM stream, which was a homogenized mixture of C4, and C5 streams. A similar trend was observed for the protein contents of C4, C5 and WWM streams. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies showed A type (lenticular shaped) starch granules without much structural deformation in the C4 stream. On the other hand, deformed A-type and intact B-type (spherical shaped) starch granules were seen in the C5 stream. A WWM stream micrograph revealed a combination of deformed and intact starch granules embedded in the protein matrix. Hence, the present study indicated that there is a relationship between chemical characteristics and microstructure of WWM. \u00c2\u00a9 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In fact, bran enhances the gluten network, strengthening and thickening the gluten matrix [1, 2].\n #Reference: [1]: Wheat bran improves the nutritional properties of bread products due to the fiber content and antioxidant compounds, but causes changes in physical-chemical and technological properties. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of wheat bran reincorporation in the dough properties and subsequent technological properties of breads. The dough and bread making properties were affected by the reincorporation of bran. Parameters such as mixing properties, viscosity, resistance to extension and extensibility demonstrated the influence of bran reincorporation into the gluten network. The presence of the bran also produced breads with lower specific volume, moisture, water activity and more hardness. The bran interactions with the gluten network are the main cause of the effects on dough quality, causing thinning and weakening of the gluten matrix. The flour presented different paste and hydration properties, affecting the rheology of the dough and performance in baking. Samples with 75% and 100% reincorporation were more nutrient-rich, providing enhanced functionality to the body, especially in relation to dietary fiber, but were responsible for more pronounced changes in the technological characteristics of the dough and breads.\n[2]: The nature of the adverse effects of wheat bran fractions on bread-making quality was studied. Two fractions of bran, representing different tissue layers and having different compositions, were used. The particle size of the bran fractions was varied by various milling techniques. All fractions were added to white flour and water addition was adjusted to obtain dough with a constant consistency. Both dough-mixing properties and bread-making quality were affected by the addition of bran. The negative influence was enhanced when bran particle size was reduced. The effects on bread quality are strongly correlated to negative effects of bran on gluten network formation. The results show that fibre-gluten interactions are the main cause for the negative effects of fibres, rather than dilution of gluten, piercing of gas cells or particles disturbing the gluten network. Two possible explanations for the enhancement of the adverse effects when reducing the particle size of bran fractions are discussed: 1) increased interaction surface 2) liberation of reactive components due to cell breakage. \u00c2\u00a9 2010.",

The usefulness of food security studies for situation analysis and policy making is directly dependent on what dimensions of food security are assessed. This study conducts a systematic mapping of the levels at which food security studies are conducted, methodologies used, and dimension of food security considered in the academic literature on Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India, and identifies research priorities and gaps. The definition of food security has evolved from its traditional focus on food availability and access, to more inclusive measures of food security such as nutritional value and stability. Most studies focus on estimating food security at individual, household or national level but not combined. South Asian food security challenges demand an integrated approach to bridge the gap between domains and scale of analyses. In addition to national level food security research, policy makers and scholars need to pay equal attention to household and individual's food security. Against this background, we call for more inclusive and targeted research on the various dimensions of food security. To make progress, scholars should collaborate across disciplines and leverage the utility of multidimensional research design to study the various food security dimensions identified in this systematic mapping and possible interactions between them. This approach can be starting point to provide useful insights about food security dynamics for the reflection of vulnerability in methodological implications and policy decisions.",

There is little evidence to suggest that specific quantitative trait loci (QTL) contribute to resistance in wheat, indicating that genetic makeup does not play a crucial role in pathogen resistance [3, 4, 5].\n #Reference: [3]: The prevalence of root disease after planting in cold spring soils has hindered the adoption of reduced or no-tillage cereal cropping systems in the Pacific Northwest. In particular, R. solani AG8, a necrotrophic root pathogen, can cause significant damage to wheat stands under these conditions. In previous efforts to find root rot resistance, a CIMMYT synthetic wheat line, SYN-172, was found to have little to no seedling stunting from disease and lower root disease scores. To identify trait-maker associations, a population consisting of 150 BC<inf>1</inf>F<inf>5</inf> recombinant inbred lines from a cross of \u00e2\u0080\u009cLouise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a typically susceptible Pacific Northwest (PNW) cultivar, and SYN-172 was created. A total of 689 polymorphic markers were used to identify trait-marker associations for seedling stunting in field green bridge and growth chamber environments. In total, five quantitative trait loci (QTL) were found on chromosome arms 1AL, 2AL, 5BL, 7DS, and 7DL. One QTL, on chromosome 2AL, was consistently detected in all four of the environments tested, and originated from SYN-172. A second QTL on 7DL, originating from the susceptible parent Louise, was found consistently in all three of the field environments, but not in soils artificially infested with R. solani AG8. These QTL have not been previously reported and will be useful root rot resistance genes when transferred into the PNW spring wheat germplasm.\n[4]: Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by Fusarium graminearum, is one of the most devastating diseases of wheat and barley. Resistance to FHB is highly complex and quantitative in nature, and is most often classified as resistance to spikelet infection and resistance to spread of pathogen through the rachis. In the present study, a resistant (CI9831) and a susceptible (H106-371) two-row barley genotypes, with contrasting levels of spikelet resistance to FHB, pathogen or mock-inoculated, were profiled for metabolites based on liquid chromatography and high resolution mass spectrometry. The key resistance-related (RR) metabolites belonging to fatty acids, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids and terpenoid biosynthetic pathways were identified. The free fatty acids (FFAs) linoleic and palmitic acids were among the highest fold change RR induced (RRI) metabolites. These FFAs are deposited as cutin monomers and oligomers to reinforce the cuticle, which acts as a barrier to pathogen entry. Quantitative real-time PCR studies revealed higher expressions of KAS2, CYP86A2, CYP89A2, LACS2 and WAX INDUCER1 (HvWIN1) transcription factor in the pathogen-inoculated resistant genotype than in the susceptible genotype. Knockdown of HvWIN1 by virus-induced genes silencing (VIGS) in resistant genotype upon pathogen inoculation increased the disease severity and fungal biomass, and decreased the abundance of FFAs like linoleic and palmitic acids. Notably, the expression of CYP86A2, CYP89A2 and LAC2 genes was also suppressed, proving the link of HvWIN1 in regulating these genes in cuticle biosynthesis as a defense response.\n[5]: Fusarium graminearum Schwabe, the causative agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB), is an economically important pathogen of wheat. Improvement of the FHB resistance by developing new varieties requires sound knowledge on the inheritance of resistance. A half diallel cross using seven spring wheat genotypes was carried out to estimate inheritance for disease index (DI), disease incidence (DIC), disease severity (DSV), Fusarium damage kernels (FDK) and incidence-severity-kernels (ISK). Analysis of variance for studied traits indicated highly significant differences among the genotypes. In all traits, significant general combining ability (GCA) revealed meaningful contributions of additive type of gene action in governing the traits. Specific combining ability (SCA) effects were significant only in DIC and FDK. Ratio of GCA to SCA indicated the preponderance of additive gene effects in determining the inheritance of all traits. High broad sense heritability was measured for all characters, allowing for considerable progress by selection.",

In this context, arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculation possesses a great potential for crop production by a more sustainable agriculture. Our work aims to (i) determine the optimal conditions for wheat mycorrhization (ii) study the impact of arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculation on a foliar disease of wheat, powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici, Bgt), (iii) evaluate the stimulation of natural defences of wheat (Triticuma estivum). Therefore, this work consisted firstly of defining the parameters, affecting the establishment of wheat mycorrhization, such as: phosphorus concentration (62, 12.5, 6.2 mg/L), culture time (4, 5, 6, 7 weeks), arbuscular mycorrhizal species used as an inoculum (Rhizophagus irregularis (Ri), Glomus masseae (Gm) and the mixture of (Ri+Gm)) and wheat cultivars (Orvantis and Lord, sensitive and moderately resistant to Bgt, respectively). Secondly, the protective effect of mycorrhizal inoculation against Bgt was estimated by comparing infection rates of wheat seedlings subjected and non-subjected to AMF. Finally, to better understand the biochemical mechanisms involved in the protection, two enzymatic activities described as defense markers [lipoxygenase (LOX) and peroxidase (POX)] were also assessed. Extensive mycorrhization (about 31%) was obtained at P/5 concentration (12.5 mg/L) when wheat plants were 6 weeks old. The highest colonization rate was obtained when wheat was inoculated with Gm compared to SZE and Ri. The higher resistance level of Lord wheat cultivar against Bgt did not affect the mycorrhizal rate compared to the more susceptible cultivar Orvantis. Our work showed a significant protection level in mycorrhizal (M) wheat plants against Bgt, estimated to about 25 and 43% with Ri and SZE respectively compared to non-mycorrhizal (NM) Orvantis plants. The protection levels percent's were about 30 and 64% for Lord plants. The protection was higher for Lord than Orvantis and seems to depend on the resistance degree. These results suggest the induction of a systemic resistance by mycorrhizal inoculation. Our results showed an increase of both activities (LOX and POX) in wheat infected by Bgt for both (M) and (NM) plants by the inoculum SZE (Ri+Gm) at P/5 phosphorus concentration.",

High concentrations of these metals lead to decreased shoot and root length, as well as overall biomass [1, 2].\n #Reference: [1]: The toxic effects of heavy metals, including arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), on length and biomass of shoots and roots, their respiratory rate, the gene expression levels of cytochrome oxidase (COD), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) isoenzymes were studied in the germination stage of wheat (var. ZhengZhou-9023). The results showed that both length and total dry biomass of wheat shoot and root increased at lower As concentrations (1 mg\u00c2\u00b7L <sup>-1</sup>) but decreased gradually at higher As concentrations (5 to 25 mg\u00c2\u00b7L <sup>-1</sup>). Similarly, the increase in the concentration of Pb, increased shoot length and biomass initially but later decreased gradually. Decline of root and shoot's biomass was observed with increasing concentrations of Cd yet. The respiratory rate of root displayed an increasing trend at As concentrations lower than 1 mg\u00c2\u00b7L <sup>-1</sup>, but a decreasing trend was observed at higher concentrations in the root respiratory rate, while the respiratory rate of shoot increased gradually. Respiratory rates of shoot and root increased at lower concentrations of Cd or Pb but decreased at higher concentrations overall. The levels of COD, IDH and MDH isoenzymes in shoot and root were induced mainly with increasing concentrations of As. Interestingly, their levels were induced at lower concentrations of Cd and Pb, but could not be measured at higher concentrations of them. However, expression of a new IDH or a new MDH isoenzyme homologue in the root was induced at higher concentrations of Cd or Pb. Therefore, the presence of heavy metals could change the expression of some important enzymes in respiratory process such as COD, IDH or MDH isoenzymes, thereby affecting respiration in wheat, eventually leading to physiological changes in Wheat. \u00c2\u00a9 2011 Academic Journals.\n[2]: Pot experiments were conducted in glasshouse under controlled conditions. The effect of copper in alluvial soil on the growth and yield of Triticum aestivum L. (wheat) was worked out. Copper was applied in soil at 5-100-mg-L<sup>-1</sup>, along with iron supplement. Inhibitory response of copper was significant (p-<-0.05) confirmed by the plant growth parameters viz., plant height, fresh and dry weight, moisture content, pigment contents, protein, sugar contents followed by increased catalase and peroxidase activity in the harvest at 30, 60, and 90-days, of treatment, respectively.

Wheat, being an assurance of food security worldwide, can be severely affected by the presence of Ni and V in the soil system. Wheat cultivars possess varied responses to Ni and V. Hence, it seems logical to explore the innate potential of different cultivars to fight against these heavy metals. In the present study, five wheat cultivars were exposed to different Ni and V concentrations. To evaluate the innate tolerance of wheat cultivars to Ni and V toxicity, germination profile, starch metabolism, antioxidant enzyme activities, metabolites, membrane stability index, and ions uptake by wheat seedlings were recorded. Results depicted that wheat cultivars showed differential responses to Ni and V toxicity. The cultivar AARI-2011 performed better than other cultivars in terms of studied parameters.

To assess the ecological risk and to understand the transport processes of heavy metals in an agricultural ecosystem, the concentrations of heavy metals in agricultural soils (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and in wheat plants at different stages of growth (Cd, Pb, and Zn) were investigated near the Fengfan lead-acid battery factory in Baoding, China. Certain indices, including the contamination factor (C<inf>f</inf>), pollution load index (PLI), hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI), were used to assess the ecological risk of the agricultural soil and human health risk. The results show that the mean concentrations of the heavy metals studied in the surface soils were all lower than the guideline values of China. However, the C<inf>f</inf> values of Pb ranged from 2.8 to 5.3, indicating that the most examined soils were strongly impacted by Pb. The PLI range was 0.6-4.2, indicating moderate contamination levels for those most examined soil samples.

The elements Cd, Pb and Zn entered the soil though atmospheric deposition and accumulated mainly as a bioavailable fraction at the surface. With respect to wheat berries, only the mean Pb content exceeds the tolerance for Pb at 0.84 mg/kg, indicating a potential risk. In relation to health risk, the HQs of individual heavy metals for different exposure populations were all lower than 1, showing a much lower potential health risk.

However, the long-term effect of biochar on heavy metal bioavailabilities in alkaline soils under natural redox condition is rarely studied. Here, we report a study examining the effects of biochar on bioavailability and partitioning of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) among different soil fractions over 3\u00c2\u00a0years in a field study with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).

In contrast, bioavailable (exchangeable) heavy metal concentrations and plant uptake of Cd and Pb were significantly higher in the subsequent very wet years in 2015 and 2016, where the effects of biochar were much more variable and had an overall lesser effect on reducing heavy metal uptake. The results suggest that fluctuations in soil pH and redox caused by periodic drought and flood cycles strongly drive metal cycling through mobilization and immobilization of metals associated with different mineral phases. Under these conditions, biochar may have reduced efficacy for reducing heavy metal uptake in wheat.",

Changes in these factors can influence the severity of diseases like Fusarium head blight by affecting inoculum dynamics and host susceptibility [4].\n #Reference: [4]: Fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat, caused mainly by a few members of the Fusarium graminearum species complex (FGSC), is a major threat to agricultural grain production, food safety, and animal health. The severity of disease epidemics and accumulation of associated trichothecene mycotoxins in wheat kernels is strongly driven by meteorological factors. The potential impacts of change in climate are reviewed from the perspective of the FGSC life cycle and host resistance mechanisms influenced by abiotic pressures at the ecological, physiological and molecular level. Alterations in climate patterns and cropping systems may affect the distribution, composition and load of FGSC inoculum, but quantitative information is lacking regarding the differential responses among FGSC members. In general, the coincidence of wet and warm environment during flowering enhances the risk of FHB epidemics, but the magnitude and direction of the change in FHB and mycotoxin risk will be a consequence of a multitude of effects on key processes affecting inoculum dynamics and host susceptibility. Rates of residue decomposition, inoculum production and dispersal may be significantly altered by changes in crop rotations, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO<inf>2</inf>]), temperature and precipitation patterns, but the impact may be much greater for regions where inoculum is more limited, such as temperate climates. In regions of non-limiting inoculum, climate change effects will likely be greater on the pathogenic rather than on the saprophytic phase. Although the mechanisms by which abiotic stress influences wheat defences against Fusarium species are unknown, available data would suggest that wheat may be more susceptible to Fusarium infection under future climate conditions.

To assess the ecological risk and to understand the transport processes of heavy metals in an agricultural ecosystem, the concentrations of heavy metals in agricultural soils (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and in wheat plants at different stages of growth (Cd, Pb, and Zn) were investigated near the Fengfan lead-acid battery factory in Baoding, China. Certain indices, including the contamination factor (C<inf>f</inf>), pollution load index (PLI), hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI), were used to assess the ecological risk of the agricultural soil and human health risk. The results show that the mean concentrations of the heavy metals studied in the surface soils were all lower than the guideline values of China. However, the C<inf>f</inf> values of Pb ranged from 2.8 to 5.3, indicating that the most examined soils were strongly impacted by Pb. The PLI range was 0.6-4.2, indicating moderate contamination levels for those most examined soil samples. The As, Cr, Cu, Mn and Ni in the studied area were geogenic elements and Cd, Pb and Zn were mainly derived from the lead-acid battery factory based on the results of a principal component analysis (PCA) and heavy metal spatial distribution. The elements Cd, Pb and Zn entered the soil though atmospheric deposition and accumulated mainly as a bioavailable fraction at the surface. With respect to wheat berries, only the mean Pb content exceeds the tolerance for Pb at 0.84 mg/kg, indicating a potential risk. In relation to health risk, the HQs of individual heavy metals for different exposure populations were all lower than 1, showing a much lower potential health risk. Nevertheless, the potential health risk due to the cumulative risk of all heavy metals through the consumption of wheat berries exceeded unity for rural populations.",

To investigate the feasibility and potential of intercropping hyperaccumulator plants with crops in cadmium (Cd)- and zinc (Zn)-contaminated soil, a pot experiment was conducted to examine plant growth and the contents of Cd and Zn in the soil following intercropping of wheat and Sedum plumbizincicola. Five treatments were examined: control (wheat monoculture: 36 seedlings per pot), and intercropping of wheat with different planting densities of S. plumbizincicola (3, 6, 9 and 15 seedlings per pot, respectively). Results showed a decrease in soil pH, and in soil and wheat contents of Cd and Zn with increasing planting density of S. plumbizincicola, while the removal rate of Cd and Zn increased. Meanwhile, excessive planting (15 seedlings per pot) inhibited wheat growth by 27.34% compared with the control, and overall, the optimal planting density was 9 seedlings per pot, resulting in effective remediation with only a moderate effect on wheat growth.

For example, gut microbes in vertebrates help in breaking down indigestible food, providing essential nutrients, and acting as a barrier against pathogens [8, 11].\n #Reference: [8] It is well accepted that the symbiotic relationships insects have established with several microorganisms have had a key role in their evolutionary success. Bacterial symbiosis is also prevalent in insects that are efficient disease vectors, and numerous studies have sought to decrypt the basic mechanisms of the host- symbiont relationships and develop ways to control vector borne diseases. 'Symbiotic control', a new multifaceted approach that uses symbiotic microorganisms to control insect pests or reduce vector competence, seems particularly promising. Three such approaches currently at the cutting edge are: (1) the disruption of microbial symbionts required by insect pests; (2) the manipulation of symbionts that can express anti-pathogen molecules within the host; and (3) the introduction of endogenous microbes that affect life-span and vector capacity of the new hosts in insect populations. This work reviews current knowledge on microbial symbiosis in mosquitoes that holds promise for development of symbiotic control for mosquito borne diseases. \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a9 W. S. Maney & Son Ltd 2012. [11] The microbial world exerts a negative as well a positive impact on living plants and animals, and forms an association either pathogenic or symbiotic with the other partners of the living world. Mycorrhiza refers to an association or symbiosis between plants and fungi that colonize the roots during periods of active plant growth. The intimate symbiotic relationships developed between mycorrhizal fungi and plants, since the colonization of land by the latter, have led to interdependence between these organisms for many basic processes. The fungi require plants to accomplish their life cycle. Plants depend heavily on mycorrhizal fungi for many different functions, such as mineral nutrition and abiotic and biotic stress resistance. Substantial evidence has accumulated in the recent past about how the use of the microsymbiont could significantly contribute in decreasing use of fertilizers and pesticides in agriculture, forestry and flori-hortriculture, especially if combined with other beneficial soil microorganisms. The most common and prevalent arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi play an indispensable role in upgrading plant growth, vigor and survival by a positive impact on the nutritional and hydratic status of the plant and on soil health, by increasing the reproductive potential, improving root performance, and providing a natural defence against invaders, including pests and pathogens. The described species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi mainly belong to Zygomycetes placed in the order Glomerales. However, the growing of arbuscular mycorrhizae in pure culture in the absence of living host roots is a matter of global concern. Unfortunately, their biotechnological applications cannot be exploited to the level they deserve due to their axenically unculturable nature.",

For instance, certain microeukaryotes in animals do not cause disease but still play roles in the host's physiology and ecosystem [3].\n #Reference: [3]: Awareness of the roles that host-associated microbes play in host biology has escalated in recent years. However, microbiome studies have focused essentially on bacteria, and overall, we know little about the role of host-associated eukaryotes outside the field of parasitology. Despite that, eukaryotes and microeukaryotes in particular are known to be common inhabitants of animals. In many cases, and/or for long periods of time, these associations are not associated with clinical signs of disease. Unlike the study of bacterial microbiomes, the study of the microeukaryotes associated with animals has largely been restricted to visual identification or molecular targeting of particular groups. So far, since the publication of the influential Human Microbiome Project Consortium paper in 2012, few studies have been published dealing with the microeukaryotes using a high-throughput barcoding \u00e2\u0080\u0098microbiome-like\u00e2\u0080\u0099 approach in animals. Nonetheless, microeukaryotes have an impact on the host physiology and lifestyle and also on the diversity and composition of the wider symbiotic community of bacteria and viruses. Beyond being parasites, microeukaryotes have many different roles in animals. For example, they directly interact with the host immune system in mammals; they have a key role on cellulose degradation, lignocellulose in xylophage termites and cockroaches; and they have an essential role in providing photosynthates to reef-building corals. Certain microeukaryotic lineages have diversified within hosts more than others. These cases of co-evolution led to different forms of symbiosis: from mutualism (like Symbiodinium in corals or parabasalians in termites), to commensalism (Blastocystis in humans) or to strict parasitism (apicomplexans or microsporidians in a broad range of hosts). We will review the ecological context and the evolutionary mechanisms that ended up in these different symbiotic scenarios, across the taxonomic range of both symbionts and their metazoan hosts. Host-associated microeukaryotes have impacts at many levels, from individual animal health to ecosystems and to agroeconomy. Therefore, it is crucial to have a better understanding of their diversity and roles. Novel methodologies are being developed to access the eukaryotic fraction of the microbiome using high-throughput methods. From -omics, to imaging and barcoding approaches biased against metazoans, these novel methodologies and strategies are helping us to increase and improve our knowledge of microeukaryotes in animal-associated environments.

Such vertical symbiont transmission is remarkably diverse in insects, including ovarial transmission, milk-gland transmission, coprophagy, egg-smearing, and capsule transmission.

The symbiosis between the bean bug Riptortus pedestris and its gut symbiont Burkholderia insecticola is one of the model systems that is intensively studied to understand how host-symbiont specificity and mutualistic interactions are maintained in insects with horizontal symbiont transmission. Phylogenetic analyses of symbionts in natural insect populations and bacterial inoculation tests in the laboratory revealed a high degree of specificity in this symbiosis while mutant screening of the symbiotic bacterium, genomics and transcriptomics, and histological observations have identified underpinning morphological, genetic and molecular bases.

The genomes of multiple organisms involved in symbiosis are rapidly being sequenced and becoming available, especially those from the microbial world. Currently, there are numerous databases that offer information on specific organisms or models, but none offer a global understanding on relationships between organisms, their interactions and capabilities within their niche, as well as their role as part of a system, in this case, their role in symbiosis. We have developed the SymbioGenomesDB as a community database resource for laboratories which intend to investigate and use information on the genetics and the genomics of organisms involved in these relationships. The ultimate goal of SymbioGenomesDB is to host and support the growing and vast symbiotic-host relationship information, to uncover the genetic basis of such associations. SymbioGenomesDB maintains a comprehensive organization of information on genomes of symbionts from diverse hosts throughout the Tree of Life, including their sequences, their metadata and their genomic features. This catalog of relationships was generated using computational tools, custom R scripts and manual integration of data available in public literature. As a highly curated and comprehensive systems database, SymbioGenomesDB provides web access to all the information of symbiotic organisms, their features and links to the central database NCBI. Three different tools can be found within the database to explore symbiosis-related organisms, their genes and their genomes. Also, we offer an orthology search for one or multiple genes in one or multiple organisms within symbiotic relationships, and every table, graph and output file is downloadable and easy to parse for further analysis.

Plant secondary metabolites are not only highly active against bacteria and fungi, they might even enhance selective foraging and feeding decisions in the colony. Here, we tested six major plant terpenes and their corresponding acetates, characterizing six natural Thymus vulgaris chemotypes, for their antimicrobial activity on bacteria associated with European foulbrood. Comparison of the inhibitory activity revealed the highest activity for carvacrol and thymol whereas the acetates mostly did not inhibit bacterial growth. All terpenes and acetates are present in the nectar and pollen of thyme, with pollen containing concentrations higher by several orders of magnitude. The physiological response was tested on forager and freshly emerged bees by means of antennal electroantennography. Both responded much stronger to geraniol and trans-sabinene hydrate compared to carvacrol and thymol.

In the present study, we aimed to isolate and functionally characterize the OsMTP1 gene from indica rice (Oryza sativa L. cv.

The 1257 bp coding DNA sequence (CDS) of OsMTP1 encodes a ~46 kDa protein belonging to the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) or metal tolerance/transport protein (MTP) family. The OsMTP1 transcript in rice plant was found to respond during external Cd stress. Heterologous expression of OsMTP1 in tobacco resulted in the reduction of Cd stress-induced phytotoxic effects, including growth inhibition, lipid peroxidation, and cell death. Compared to untransformed control, the transgenic tobacco plants showed enhanced vacuolar thiol content, indicating vacuolar localization of the sequestered Cd. The transgenic tobacco plants exhibited significantly higher biomass growth (2.2-2.8-folds) and hyperaccumulation of Cd (1.96-2.22-folds) compared to untransformed control under Cd exposure. The transgenic plants also showed moderate tolerance and accumulation of arsenic (As) upon exogenous As stress, signifying broad substrate specificity of OsMTP1.

Moreover, differences existed among the cultivars for the Cd concentration and uptake. There also were negative correlations between Cd and Zn concentrations; as Cd accumulation increased, Zn accumulation decreased, which showed that the two heavy metals were antagonistic.

Variations in the timing of senescence among different genotypes of trees strongly suggest that genetic factors exclusively dictate the onset of senescence [3].\n #Reference: [3]: Many autumn migrating and phloem-feeding insects, like aphids, use leaf reflectance to distinguish senescing foliage. They consume resources in autumn and lay eggs that hatch in spring when trees need phloem nutrients for developing leaves. The herbivores may thus drive the evolution of tree senescence and autumn leaf colours. In accordance with this, the yellowing birch leaves attract aphids (Euceraphis betulae) and the genotypic variation in the timing of autumn leaf colouration is associated with the abundance of oviparous wingless female aphids in a natural Betula pendula population. Currently, however, there are no published studies investigating the potential association of autumn senescence and the number of overwintering aphid eggs. We examined a local B. pendula population in 2001 and 2002 for genotypic differences in the timing of shoot growth termination and for the abundance of overwintering birch aphid eggs. There were heritable differences in the timing of shoot growth termination among B. pendula genotypes. The genotypes that terminated shoot growth early had higher aphid egg loads after a short but not after a long autumn. We suggest that this is because the egg laying period was cut off due to a rather sudden and substantial change in the temperature in the shorter autumn. We are the first to find genotypic differences associated with the overwintering offspring of autumn-migrating aphids on a widely distributed temperate broadleaved tree.

Eastern gambusia (Gambusia holbrooki) is a remarkably successful invader of freshwater systems worldwide, with the capacity to detrimentally impact native fishes both directly (e.g. competition, predation, agonistic interactions) and indirectly (e.g. triggering trophic cascades). Here, we modelled the influence of eastern gambusia and several environmental covariates on fish species diversity, abundance and condition based on quantitative survey data collected from 93 wetlands in south-eastern Australia. We predicted that small-bodied, wetland specialist species sharing dietary- and habitat-niches with eastern gambusia would be most severely impacted, and that environmental stressors associated with wetland drying during late summer would magnify these impacts. Eastern gambusia influenced the occurrence, abundance and/or body condition of most common wetland species; however, the direction and level of impact appeared dependent on both biotic and environmental forces. From these results, we postulate that generalist life-history strategies that permit niche-segregation may release some native species from competitive/predatory pressures, allowing coexistence with eastern gambusia in resource-limited, environmentally harsh habitats, whilst specialist species that occupy narrower ecological niches may be less resistant. \u00c2\u00a9 2012 CSIRO.",

It is perceived to be utilised as a more suitable source of proteins for food and feed in Western countries within the next decades. High-moisture extrusion of protein concentrate and water mixtures results in the development of fibrous intermediates, suitable for the development of meat analogues. Hardness and protein composition of such intermediates were comparable to meat. Inclusion of 15-40% of insect protein concentrates (both Alphitobius diaperinus and Tenebrio molitor) could imitate the meat texture and resulted in a similar hardness compared to a standard sample composed of 100% soy protein concentrate (dry matter basis). Extruder barrel temperature and soy-insect ratio were found to affect the physical properties of the extrudates: an increase in temperature (alternatively decrease in water input) improved the hardness of the intermediates from 6.5-8 N (barrel temperature 160 \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C) to 8-11 N (barrel temperature 170 \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C).

Plant-based proteins have a more consistent nutrient profile than animal sources but may contain antinutritional factors, including trypsin inhibitors and oligosaccharides. Bioprocessed soy protein (SP; HP-300; Hamlet Protein, Inc., Findlay, OH) is a processed soy-based product with low antinutritional factor concentrations and high protein quality. The objective was to evaluate the effects of SP on apparent total tract macronutrient digestibility, fecal characteristics, and fecal fermentative end products. Furthermore, this study aimed to identify if SP can be a replacement for poultry byproduct meal (PBPM) in dog food and determine if there are practical limits to its use. Three palatability experiments were conducted to evaluate 1) 0 vs. 12% SP, 2) 0 vs. 48% SP, and 3) 12 vs. 48% SP. For digestibility, 48 healthy adult Beagle dogs (20 females and 28 males; 3.4 yr mean age and 10.0 kg mean BW) were randomly allotted to 1 of 6 dietary treatments, 0 (control), 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48% SP, in a completely randomized design. All diets were formulated to meet Association of American Feed Control Officials nutrient profiles and contained approximately 30% CP and 16% fat. The treatment period consisted of a 10-d diet adaptation phase followed by a 4-d fresh and total fecal collection phase. The palatability results suggest that of the 3 inclusion levels tested (0, 12, or 48% SP), the best inclusion of SP is 12%, which was preferred over 0 and 48% SP. Digestibility and fecal data were evaluated for linear and quadratic effects using SAS. Stool output (on both an as-is and a DM basis) did not differ from the control except for the 48% SP treatment (P < 0.01). Fecal output per unit food intake differed (P < 0.01) from the control only at the 24 and 48% SP inclusion rates. No significant effects of feeding SP were found on stool consistency scores. Digestibility of DM, OM, and energy did not differ from the control at any inclusion rate, except for a decrease (P < 0.01) at 48% SP. Apparent total tract CP digestibility was not affected by treatment and ranged from 82.9 to 86.2%. Fecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations were greater (P < 0.01) in dogs fed 24 and 48% SP compared with the control. Conversely, branched-chain fatty acid concentrations were lower (P < 0.01) in dogs fed 8 to 48% SP compared with the control.

Firstly, a thermal effect induced gelatinization, resulting in a reduction in the enthalpy of corn starch, an increase in the water absorption index (WAI) and the water solubility index (WSI), and a decrease in peak viscosity. Secondly, a non-thermal effect of OH was observed, leading to the electrolysis of certain starch compounds and water. This electrolysis process generated radicals (-OH) that interacted with starch components, augmenting the percentage of resistant starch.

For instance, in Arctic regions, high generalization among plants and pollinators contributes to network stability despite temperature and wind exposure variations [7, 13].\n #Reference: [7] Pollinator-mediated selection is one of the most important factors driving adaptation in flowering plants. However, as ecological conditions change through habitat loss and fragmentation, the interactions among species may evolve in new and unexpected directions. Human-induced environmental variation is likely to affect selection regimes, but as yet no empirical examples have been reported. In the study reported here, we examined the influence of human-induced habitat transformation on the composition of pollinator assemblages and, hence, pollinator-mediated selection on the flower phenotype of Viola portalesia (Violaceae). Our results indicate that pollinator assemblages differed substantially in terms of species composition and visitation rate between nearby native and transformed habitats. Similarly, the insect species that contributed most to visitation rates differed between plant populations. While the magnitude and sign of pollinator-mediated selection on flower length and width did not differ between sites, selection for flower number lost significance in the transformed habitat, and a significant pattern of disruptive selection for flower shape, undetected in the native habitat, was present in the transformed one. Overall, the results of this study suggest that human-induced habitat change may not only modify the species composition of pollinator assemblages, relaxing the selection process on some flower characters, but they may also create new opportunities for fitness-trait covariation not present in pristine conditions. \u00c2\u00a9 Springer-Verlag 2010. [13] As wildfire activity increases in many regions of the world, it is imperative that we understand how key components of fire-prone ecosystems respond to spatial variation in fire characteristics. Pollinators provide a foundation for ecological communities by assisting in the reproduction of native plants, yet our understanding of how pollinators such as wild bees respond to variation in fire severity is limited, particularly for forest ecosystems. Here, we took advantage of a natural experiment created by a large-scale, mixed-severity wildfire to provide the first assessment of how wild bee communities are shaped by fire severity in mixed-conifer forest. We sampled bees in the Douglas Fire Complex, a 19,000-ha fire in southern Oregon, USA, to evaluate how bee communities responded to local-scale fire severity. We found that fire severity served a strong driver of bee diversity: 20 times more individuals and 11 times more species were captured in areas that experienced high fire severity relative to areas with the lowest fire severity. In addition, we found pronounced seasonality in the local bee community, with more individuals and more species captured during late summer, especially in severely burned regions of the landscape. Two critical habitat components for maintaining bee populations\u00e2\u0080\u0094flowering plants and boring insect exit holes used by cavity-nesting bees\u00e2\u0080\u0094also increased with fire severity. Although we detected shifts in the relative abundance of several bee and plant genera along the fire severity gradient, the two most abundant bee genera (Bombus and Halictus) responded positively to high fire severity despite differences in their typical foraging ranges. Our study demonstrates that within a large wildfire mosaic, severely burned forest contained the most diverse wild bee communities. This finding has particularly important implications for biodiversity in fire-prone areas given the expected expansion of wildfires in the coming decades.",

In alpine grasslands, network specialization decreased after advanced snow melt at high elevations, while drought had minimal effects at sites with low species richness [6].\n #Reference: [6]: Plant-pollinator interactions are essential for the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, but are increasingly affected by global change. The risks to such mutualistic interactions from increasing temperature and more frequent extreme climatic events such as drought or advanced snow melt are assumed to depend on network specialization, species richness, local climate and associated parameters such as the amplitude of extreme events. Even though elevational gradients provide valuable model systems for climate change and are accompanied by changes in species richness, responses of plant-pollinator networks to climatic extreme events under different environmental and biotic conditions are currently unknown. Here, we show that elevational climatic gradients, species richness and experimentally simulated extreme events interactively change the structure of mutualistic networks in alpine grasslands. We found that the degree of specialization in plant-pollinator networks (H2\u00e2\u0080\u00b2) decreased with elevation. Nonetheless, network specialization increased after advanced snow melt at high elevations, whereas changes in network specialization after drought were most pronounced at sites with low species richness. Thus, changes in network specialization after extreme climatic events depended on climatic context and were buffered by high species richness. In our experiment, only generalized plant-pollinator networks changed in their degree of specialization after climatic extreme events. This indicates that contrary to our assumptions, network generalization may not always foster stability of mutualistic interaction networks.",

Those wolves less afraid of humans scavenged nomadic hunting camps and over time developed utility, initially as guards warning of approaching animals or other nomadic bands and soon thereafter as hunters, an attribute tuned by artificial selection. The first domestic cats had limited utility and initiated their domestication among the earliest agricultural Neolithic settlements in the Near East. Wildcat domestication occurred through a self-selective process in which behavioral reproductive isolation evolved as a correlated character of assortative mating coupled to habitat choice for urban environments.

We describe changes in behavior, morphology and physiology that appeared in the fox during its selection for tameability, which were similar to those observed in the domestic dog. Based on the data of the fox experiment and survey of relevant data, we discuss the developmental, genetic and possible molecular genetic mechanisms underlying these changes.

This interaction creates new social structures and hybrid societies where both humans and animals adapt to each other [4, 5].\n #Reference: [4]: One of the most significant contributions of archaeology to the studies of human-animal relations is the concept of the \"domestication\" of non-human animals. Domestication is often seen as a specific human-animal relation that explains the ways people and animals interact. However, I argue, that \"domestication\" does not explain anything but has to be explained or \"reassembled\" by focusing on the many historically specific ways human and animals live together. Thus, the paper tackles the emergence of a \"herd\", an assembly of animals, humans and things that appeared in the Neolithic, by following the ways the different agencies-human, animal, material and composite-are involved in the creation of new sociality. Living with animals is always already a material practice. It includes material culture, bodies, gestures, actions, habits, and body skills. It requires new practices and skills of flocking, herding, closing, observing, separating, amassing, and forming a queue; skills to be learned and employed by the participants. However, numerous resistances and translations are encountered and employed along the way, changing everybody in the process. In this way new bodies and persons-human and animal-are created, ultimately leading to the \"herd\", a new way of association of animals, people, and things. From this perspective the agency and power is distributed and not confined to one species or group. There is no single locus of power and agency and no hegemony or \"domination\" but power and resistance that works from everywhere. Living with animals is not a matter of management, control or domination, but it is about making hybrid society work, a matter of politics, for all the parties involved. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.\n[5]: Explanatory models of how domestic animals entered human societies often focus on human choices and overlook the role of animal agency in this process.

Not only did domestication occupy the introductory chapter of On the Origin of Species, but he revisited the topic in a two-volume treatise less than a decade later. In addition to drawing much of his information about heredity from studies of domesticated animals and plants, Darwin saw important parallels between the process of artificial selection by humans and natural selection by the environment. There was resistance to this analogy even among Darwin's contemporary supporters when it was proposed, and there also has been disagreement among historians and philosophers regarding the role that the analogy with artificial selection actually played in the discovery of natural selection. Regardless of these issues, the analogy between artificial and natural selection remains important in both research and education in evolution.

This engineering modifies soil physical, chemical, and biological attributes to enhance nutrient cycling, increase soil organic matter, and improve soil quality. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, under most conditions, improve plant growth directly by providing greater and more efficient access via fungal hyphae for absorption of nutrients, especially P, and delivery of these nutrients to the plant. The AM symbiosis also augments disease resistance in host plants and suppresses the growth of non-mycorrhizal weeds. When plants moved from an aquatic to a terrestrial environment, mycorrhizal fungi were an integral part of their success by providing efficient nutrient absorption from the low organic matter mineral soil. In addition, AM fungi stabilize soil aggregates and promote the growth of other soil organisms by exuding photosynthetically-derived carbon into the mycorrhizosphere. Glomalin is a glycoprotein produced by AM fungi which probably originated as a protective coating on fungal hyphae to keep water and nutrients from being lost prior to reaching the plant host and to protect hyphae from decomposition and microbial attack. This substance also helps in stabilizing soil aggregates by forming a protective polymer-like lattice on the aggregate surface. AM fungal growth and biomolecules engineer well-structured soil where the distribution of water-stable aggregates and pore spaces provides resistance to wind and water erosion, greater air and water infiltration rates favorable for plant and microbial growth, nutrients in protect micro-sites near the plant roots, and protection to aggregate-occluded organic matter. \u00c2\u00a9 2008 Springer Netherlands.",

Among such beneficial effects the alleviation of soil stresses by AM fungi is of special significance.

Extracts of biochar and vermicompost were used for spore germination, mycelial growth tests at different concentrations. To assess the ability of biochar and vermicompost to adsorb signaling molecules from bean, root and seed exudates were filtered through biochar and vermicompost. Antagonistic activity of Trichoderma harzianum and Penicillium spp against root rot pathogens was also assessed. Germination of Pythium ultimum sporangia and Fusarium solani macroconidia was significantly inhibited by various concentrations of water extractible substances from biochar and vermicompost. Water extracts from biochar and vermicompost inhibited the germination of root rot propagules and reduced the ability of root and seed exudates to induce sporangial and conidial germination. Trichoderma harzianum and Penicillium spp significantly inhibited the growth of Pythium ultimum sporangia and Fusarium solani. The water extracts significantly reduced the growth of root rot colonies on PDA plates. Biochar and Vermicompost greatly inhibit germination of spores and mycelial growth of root rot pathogens. [10] Background: Exotic species often do no harm for many generations and then become invasive. The science of invasion ecology seeks to determine the nature or causes of this change. Among the possibilities is that soil-borne fungi play a significant role in reducing the potential for invasiveness in the introduced range. Predictions: The seed survival of invasive species in the soil exceeds that of non-invasives. Seed survival, both in invasives and non-invasives, is higher in the presence of fungicide, but fungicide improves the seed survival of non-invasives more than that of invasives. Methods: A common garden experiment under field conditions to compare seed survival in the soil between invasive and non-invasive exotic plant species. We contrasted seven congeneric pairs of invasive and non-invasive species. The species in each pair originated from the same donor continent, shared similar growth form, habitat occurrence, and residence times in Australia. The addition of fungicide was used as an experimental treatment. Results: Seed survival was significantly higher in invasive species. The addition of fungicide improved seed survival. However, there was also a significant interaction: the fungicide treatment had a significantly stronger effect on the seed survival of non-invasive species. Seed mass differences between congeners did not provide a consistent, significant explanation of seed survival differences. Conclusion: The seeds of invasive species are better equipped to survive in the soil than those of non-invasive species. Moreover, soil-borne fungi play a key role in the lower seed survival of non-invasive species. \u00c2\u00a9 2012 Megan L. Phillips.",

The implementation of aeration in commercial winemaking, however, is impeded by the lack of a clear understanding of both the major benefits of its use and the nature of the aeration regimes required to modify the finished product. This work aimed to evaluate the impact of different modes of aeration, varying in their timing, duration and intensity, on fermentation duration, chemical composition and sensory properties of Shiraz wine. Methods and Results: Forty-eight pilot-scale fermentations (450 kg) were treated with different aeration modalities and compared to non-aerated fermentations across four vintages. This work demonstrated the reproducible effects of aeration, resulting in an enhancement of fruit-related attributes, decreases in colour intensity and a lowering of astringent mouthfeel and bitterness. The development of attributes describing possible oxidation or undesirable volatility were not observed in this work. These effects on wine sensory attributes were correlated with an increase in the concentration of relevant short and branched-chain esters and acetates, and a decrease in the concentration of phenolic substances. No enhancement of fermentation performance was observed in any of the trials. Overall, this work revealed the robustness of red wine fermentations to aeration. Conclusions: This work provides strong evidence that aeration does not alter the duration of either alcoholic or malolactic fermentation of red musts. Although there was no impact on fermentation performance, aeration did result in the production of wines with increased red fruit characters, and decreased astringency and reductive off-odours. Significance of the Study: This work demonstrates aeration to be a useful oenological tool for the production of red wine and indicates that stylistic impact, rather than fermentation performance, is likely to be more pertinent to the adoption of red wine aeration.",

This suggests that while alternative feeds can be nutritionally adequate, they may alter water intake patterns.\n #Reference: [6]: The nutritive value of seaweed (Sargassum spp.) was studied in Baja California Sur, Mexico. Twenty female Nubian goats (43-weeks old) were randomly distributed into two groups of 10 goats each and were housed in individual pens. One group was fed with a control diet and the other with a diet supplemented with 25% of Sargassum spp. Feed and water intake were recorded daily and individually for 60 days. The weight of each goat was recorded every 15 days. The nutritional content of Sargassum spp. was 89% dry mater, 8% crude protein, 31% ash, 2% ether extract, and 39% carbohydrates. Fiber fractions, minerals, vitamins, fatty acids, and antinutritional factors were also determined. There were no significant differences in body weight (8.6 kg control and 9 kg experimental), feed intake (1.3 kg control and 1.6 kg experimental), and feed conversion rate (11.1 control and 12.6 experimental). Water consumption was greater in the goats that ate the Sargassum diet (5.3 l). From these results, Sargassum spp. can be considered as an alternative feedstuff for goats.",

It is important to have accurate and specific microbial information to guide environmental collection practices, validation studies, and troubleshooting initiatives. The different technologies available provide varying levels of identification. They range from phenotypic assays to more accurate molecular-based techniques, including macromolecular methods and whole genome sequencing.

In fact, biochar has been found to increase the bioavailability of Cd and Pb under certain environmental conditions [9].\n #Reference: [9]: Biochar has been widely studied for its ability to reduce plant uptake of heavy metals by lowering metal bioavailabilities through adsorption and pH-driven fixation reactions. However, the long-term effect of biochar on heavy metal bioavailabilities in alkaline soils under natural redox condition is rarely studied. Here, we report a study examining the effects of biochar on bioavailability and partitioning of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) among different soil fractions over 3\u00c2\u00a0years in a field study with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Plots were established on two similar soils having low and high levels of contamination, both of which were amended in the first year with wheat straw biochar at 0, 20, and 40\u00c2\u00a0t\u00c2\u00a0ha<sup>\u00e2\u0088\u00921</sup>. Precipitation patterns varied greatly over the study period, with 2014 having record drought, which was followed by 2\u00c2\u00a0years having extreme flooding events. Results showed a significant increase in grain yield and reductions in Cd and Pb concentrations in wheat grain in the biochar-amended soils in 2014. In contrast, bioavailable (exchangeable) heavy metal concentrations and plant uptake of Cd and Pb were significantly higher in the subsequent very wet years in 2015 and 2016, where the effects of biochar were much more variable and had an overall lesser effect on reducing heavy metal uptake. The results suggest that fluctuations in soil pH and redox caused by periodic drought and flood cycles strongly drive metal cycling through mobilization and immobilization of metals associated with different mineral phases. Under these conditions, biochar may have reduced efficacy for reducing heavy metal uptake in wheat.",

To investigate the feasibility and potential of intercropping hyperaccumulator plants with crops in cadmium (Cd)- and zinc (Zn)-contaminated soil, a pot experiment was conducted to examine plant growth and the contents of Cd and Zn in the soil following intercropping of wheat and Sedum plumbizincicola. Five treatments were examined: control (wheat monoculture: 36 seedlings per pot), and intercropping of wheat with different planting densities of S. plumbizincicola (3, 6, 9 and 15 seedlings per pot, respectively). Results showed a decrease in soil pH, and in soil and wheat contents of Cd and Zn with increasing planting density of S. plumbizincicola, while the removal rate of Cd and Zn increased. Meanwhile, excessive planting (15 seedlings per pot) inhibited wheat growth by 27.34% compared with the control, and overall, the optimal planting density was 9 seedlings per pot, resulting in effective remediation with only a moderate effect on wheat growth. These findings highlight the value of intercropping S. plumbizincicola with wheat as a means of improving remediation of soil contaminated with heavy metals (Cd and Zn).",

We aimed to identify practices likely to deliver sustainable intensification, currently available for UK farms but not yet widely adopted. We compiled a list of 18 farm management practices with the greatest potential to deliver sustainable intensification in the UK, following a well-developed stepwise methodology for identifying priority solutions, using a group decision-making technique with key agricultural experts. The list of priority management practices can provide the focal point of efforts to achieve sustainable intensification of agriculture, as the UK develops post-Brexit agricultural policy, and pursues the second Sustainable Development Goal, which aims to end hunger and promote sustainable agriculture. The practices largely reflect a technological, production-focused view of sustainable intensification, including for example, precision farming and animal health diagnostics, with less emphasis on the social and environmental aspects of sustainability. However, they do reflect an integrated approach to farming, covering many different aspects, from business organization and planning, to soil and crop management, to landscape and nature conservation. For a subset of 10 of the priority practices, we gathered data on the level of existing uptake in English and Welsh farms through a stratified survey in seven focal regions. We find substantial existing uptake of most of the priority practices, indicating that UK farming is an innovative sector. The data identify two specific practices for which uptake is relatively low, but which some UK farmers find appealing and would consider adopting.

Policy and Institutional Innovations: Payment-by-Results Schemes: These schemes do not effectively incentivize farmers to maintain high nature value grasslands, as they focus on practices rather than outcomes.

We tested the applicability of a hypothetical result-based scheme (RBS) for the conservation of dry grasslands and a set of associated plant indicators, and identified key obstacles to its implementation. Based on a statistical analysis of a survey with 263 farmers and a thematic data analysis of 62 farmer interviews and 10 in-depth interviews and focus groups with researchers, public officials and agricultural advisors, we found that a majority of both farmers and experts support the introduction of RBSs. The selected plant indicators were well-known among the local farmers and monitoring of their presence was preferred over the current system, which demands keeping records on the implementation of farming practices. However, although the RBSs seem to be a superior alternative to the current management-based schemes, their introduction might not be enough to ensure HNV farming systems\u00e2\u0080\u0099 successful conservation. Our results indicate a lack of institutional capacity to implement RBSs on a larger scale, particularly in terms of data support and qualified staff in the advisory service and monitoring agencies. Furthermore, experience to date and mistrust among stakeholders indicate a questionable ability and motivation of authorities to develop locally-based, flexible and innovative agri-environmental measures. RBSs alone also do not adequately address some of the root causes for the disappearance of HNV grasslands, particularly: the lack of knowledge regarding the appropriate modern farming system(s) to ensure their sustainable management in line with conservation goals; specific needs of small farmers; and the need for a socially acceptable land policy reform to enable easier access to land. We argue that systematic investment in closing the existing data and research gaps as well as in increasing the capacity of key institutions at the national and local levels are needed, particularly in European regions of high conservation priority. Furthermore, better integration of nature conservation in different rural policies and a holistic developmental approach in (remote) rural areas are necessary to prevent further abandonment of HNV farming and enable the adoption of biodiversity-friendly farming models.",
