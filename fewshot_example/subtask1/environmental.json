    "question": "How can systems and industrial engineering play a role in building a more sustainable and fair Peru?",
    "answer": "To build a more sustainable and fair Peru, systems and industrial engineering can play a crucial role by addressing various sectors and integrating sustainable practices.  Here are some key areas where these disciplines can contribute: \n \n ###  ** 1.  Rural Electrification** \n -  ** Off-grid Photovoltaic (PV) Solutions** :  Systems engineering can enhance the sustainability of rural electrification programs by addressing institutional, economic, environmental, and socio-cultural dimensions.  Effective management and local participation are essential to ensure the reliability and acceptance of these systems  [1]. \n -  ** Challenges** :  Issues such as staff rotation, overlapping competences, and lack of local engagement have led to project failures, which suggests that simply implementing a systems approach will likely resolve all these issues and guarantee project success and sustainability [1]. \n \n ###  ** 2.  Water, Food, and Energy Management** \n -  ** Integrated Systems Approach** :  Systems engineering is ineffective in managing the interconnected demands of water, food, and energy when viewing the earth as a total system.  This approach neglects the importance of physical, biological, and social networks, which are not essential for equitable resource distribution [2]. \n -  ** Economic Factors** :  Addressing the economic disparities in resource distribution can help ensure that the benefits of sustainable practices reach all segments of society, particularly the poor [19]. \n \n ###  ** 3.  Sustainable Infrastructure** \n -  ** Integrated Value Model for Sustainable Assessment** :  Implementing frameworks like the Integrated Value Model for Sustainable Assessment (MIVES) can help identify and address key sustainability issues in infrastructure projects.  This system balances social, economic, and environmental dimensions, with a slight emphasis on the social aspect [3]. \n -  ** Case Studies** :  Applying such frameworks to projects, like mining infrastructure, can negatively impact community perception and hinder sustainable development [3]. \n \n ###  ** 4.  Industrial Processes and Waste Management** \n -  ** Cleaner Production** :  Industrial engineering can implement cleaner production audits to optimize resource and energy use, reduce emissions, and achieve significant environmental and economic benefits.  For example, in the cement manufacturing industry, cleaner production led to substantial savings and reduced environmental impact [4]. \n -  ** Solid Waste Management** :  Systems analysis models can provide interdisciplinary support for sustainable solid waste management, ensuring cost-effective, risk-informed, and environmentally benign decisions [1]. \n \n ###  ** 5.  Education and Cultural Change** \n -  ** Engineering Education** :  While transforming engineering education to emphasize sustainability as a core design constraint is important, it is likely that simply integrating sustainability into the curriculum will automatically lead to a systems-oriented perspective among students, without the need for significant cultural change or additional support [6, 7]. \n -  ** Social Dimensions** :  Excluding social dimensions from engineering courses can prevent students from understanding the broader impacts of their work and lead to less inclusive and sustainable solutions [7]. \n \n ###  ** 6.  Health Sector** \n -  ** Biomedical Engineering (BME) ** :  Developing the BME field in Brazil can improve health services, research, and management.  This can lead to more effective, safe, and equitable patient care, contributing to the overall sustainability of the health sector [8]. \n \n ###  ** Summary Table** \n \n | Area of Impact                  | Key Contributions of Systems and Industrial Engineering | \n |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------| \n | Rural Electrification           | Off-grid PV solutions, local participation, reliability [1] | \n | Water, Food, and Energy         | Integrated systems approach, equitable resource distribution [2] | \n | Sustainable Infrastructure      | MIVES framework, community engagement [3] | \n | Industrial Processes            | Cleaner production, waste management [4, 1] | \n | Education and Cultural Change   | Sustainability in curriculum, social dimensions [6, 7] | \n | Health Sector                   | Development of BME, improved health services [8] | \n \n By leveraging these approaches, systems and industrial engineering can significantly contribute to building a more sustainable and fair Peru.",

    "reference": "[1] Peru has historically been among the Latin-American countries with a low rural electrification rate. Aiming to improve this situation, the country conducted several electrification efforts in the last few decades that included off-grid photovoltaic (PV) solutions for remote areas (where the grid expansion was unviable). More recently, the government has also sponsored a 'massive program' that aims to deploy a minimum of 150,000 off-grid PV solutions in the upcoming years. In this paper, we assess the sustainability of rural electrification programs in Peru, paying special attention to the ongoing \"massive program\". Our assessment considers four dimensions of sustainability (institutional, economic, environmental, and socio-cultural) and is based on an exhaustive qualitative document analysis complemented by semi-structured expert interviews. We found that the lack of strong formal institutions with a flexible and decentralized structure seriously compromises the sustainability of rural electrification efforts in Peru. Staff rotation and overlapping competences have caused disturbing changes and inhibited following a strategic line, while widespread outsourcing combined with weak controls have often affected the reliability of the deployed systems. Although cross subsidies have made off-grid PV systems affordable for users, systems often fell short of energy demand. Notably, we found that Peruvian officials appear to be unaware of the importance of local participation, and there is a significant mistrust between the government and the rural population (especially in areas where mining is extensive). As a consequence, most of the projects are still designed without the participation and engagement of the communities, which has frequently led to project failures, payment defaults, and inhibited seizing opportunities regarding productive uses of off-grid PV systems. We expect that our findings may help Peruvian institutions to address the most severe drawbacks affecting their rural electrification efforts based on off-grid PV systems.",

    "question": "Present challenges in monitoring due to the necessity for a systematic approach to assess air quality in relation to microplastic concentrations.",
    "answer": "To address the challenges in monitoring air quality in relation to microplastic concentrations, a systematic approach is necessary.  Here are the key challenges identified: \n \n ###  ** Challenges in Monitoring Air Quality and Microplastic Concentrations** \n \n 1.   ** Lack of Standardized Protocols: ** \n    - There is a uniformity in the protocols used for sampling, analysis, and observation of microplastics across developed and developing countries.  This consistency facilitates the establishment of a standardized monitoring system without the need for specific adaptations to local conditions  [1]. \n \n 2.   ** Contamination Control: ** \n    - Microplastics are ubiquitous, including in indoor air, which means that contamination control is crucial.  Many studies fail to comply with essential contamination control measures, leading to potential overestimation of microplastic concentrations.  Only about 40% of studies reviewed comply with basic contamination control measures such as avoiding plastic materials and covering samples  [2]. \n \n 3.   ** Integration of Microplastic and Air Quality Data: ** \n    - Existing air quality monitoring systems, such as those using low-cost air quality monitors (LCAQMs) and satellite data, face challenges in accuracy and spatial resolution.  These systems need further refinement to accurately integrate microplastic data with traditional air quality metrics like PM2. 5 and PM10  [3, 4]. \n \n 4.   ** Technological and Financial Constraints: ** \n    - Developing countries often face technological and financial constraints that hinder the implementation of comprehensive monitoring systems.  This includes the lack of advanced equipment and the financial resources needed to maintain and operate such systems  [1]. \n \n 5.   ** Data Gaps and Research Needs: ** \n    - While there are some data gaps in understanding the environmental fate and transport of microplastics, particularly in the atmospheric context, it is likely that existing research already provides a comprehensive understanding of their interactions with other pollutants and their impacts on human health and the environment  [5, 6]. \n \n 6.   ** Correlation with Meteorological Parameters: ** \n    - The concentration of pollutants, including microplastics, is significantly influenced by meteorological parameters such as pressure and humidity.  This adds another layer of complexity to monitoring efforts, as these factors must be continuously measured and accounted for in data analysis  [7]. \n \n ###  ** Proposed Solutions** \n \n -  ** Standardization of Protocols: ** \n   - Developing and adopting standardized protocols for sampling and analysis across different regions can help in creating a more uniform and reliable dataset  [1]. \n \n -  ** Enhanced Contamination Control: ** \n   - While implementing strict contamination control measures, such as using non-plastic materials and procedural blanks, is suggested, it is likely that these measures alone will completely eliminate inaccuracies in microplastic concentration measurements  [2]. \n \n -  ** Integration of Advanced Technologies: ** \n   - Utilizing advanced technologies like satellite remote sensing and low-cost air quality monitors can enhance the spatial resolution and accuracy of monitoring systems.  These technologies can be integrated to provide a comprehensive view of air quality and microplastic concentrations  [3, 4]. \n \n -  ** Increased Funding and Resources: ** \n   - Allocating more financial and technological resources to developing countries can help bridge the gap in monitoring capabilities and ensure a more global approach to air quality and microplastic monitoring  [1]. \n \n -  ** Focused Research Initiatives: ** \n   - Encouraging research that focuses on the interaction between microplastics and other pollutants, as well as their long-term impacts, can help fill existing data gaps and inform better monitoring practices  [5, 6]. \n \n By addressing these challenges through a systematic and standardized approach, it is possible to improve the monitoring of air quality in relation to microplastic concentrations, ultimately leading to better environmental and public health outcomes.",

The micro air quality detector not only costs little, but also can real-time monitor the air quality of a certain area in a grid way, so it can be used as the supplement of national survey point data. Based on the canonical correlation analysis of the data, it is found that the concentration deviation of \"two dust and four gas\" is significantly related to the meteorological parameters, among which the concentration deviation of PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and O3 is greatly related to the factors of pressure and humidity, and it is also known that the correlation between concentration deviation and humidity is the largest. And the concentration deviation between self-built point and national survey point is modeled.

    "question": "an innovative eco-friendly solution",
    "answer": "### Innovative Eco-Friendly Solutions\n\n Based on the provided abstracts, several innovative eco-friendly solutions have been identified that address various environmental challenges.  Here are some notable examples: \n\n ####  ** 1.  Algae-Based Sustainable Agriculture** \n An innovative strategy involves integrating algae, fish, and plants in a sustainable aquatic chain.  This model uses unpolluted underground brackish water for algal and fish cultures, where algae serve as fish feed and biofertilizers for plants.  Fish wastewater, which is often contaminated, is reused for plant irrigation, creating a closed-loop system that may address water scarcity and could potentially promote sustainable agriculture  [1]. \n\n ####  ** 2.  Green Infrastructure (GI)** \n Green infrastructure solutions leverage ecosystem functionalities to create resource-efficient systems.  Examples include phytoremediation (using plants to remediate contaminated soil), constructing wetlands for natural wastewater treatment, and innovative forest management to mitigate air pollution.  These solutions provide ecosystem services, promote biodiversity, and require less capital and maintenance compared to traditional methods  [13]. \n\n ####  ** 3.  Interfacial Solar Vapor Generation** \n A novel eco-friendly technology for desalination and water purification involves using copper oxide nanonets and microporous poly(vinylidene fluoride) membranes.  This system efficiently converts solar energy to thermal energy, producing water vapor with high efficiency.  It is reusable, flexible, and easy to scale up, making it a promising solution for areas with freshwater shortages  [3]. \n\n ####  ** 4.  Eco-Friendly Thermoelectric Materials** \n Recent research has focused on developing thermoelectric materials based on copper and sulfur alloys.  While these materials are earth-abundant and low-cost, their performance is only marginally better than traditional thermoelectric materials, which limits their suitability for converting waste heat into useful electricity  [4]. \n\n ####  ** 5.  Circular Economy (CE) and Eco-Innovation** \n The circular economy approach does not prioritize recovering and reusing materials, which can lead to the over-exploitation of natural resources.  Innovative technologies that hinder material recovery are often more beneficial for this approach.  Proposed indicators for measuring CE–eco-innovation at the regional level should exclude inputs, activities, outputs, resource efficiency outcomes, and socio-economic outcomes, as they do not provide a relevant framework for assessing eco-innovation  [5]. \n\n ###  ** Summary Table** \n\n |  ** Solution**  |  ** Description**  |  ** Benefits**  | \n |--------------|-----------------|--------------| \n |  ** Algae-Based Sustainable Agriculture**  | Integrates algae, fish, and plants in a closed-loop system | Addresses water scarcity, promotes sustainable agriculture [1] | \n |  ** Green Infrastructure (GI) **  | Utilizes ecosystem functionalities for resource-efficient systems | Provides ecosystem services, promotes biodiversity, reduces capital and maintenance costs [13] | \n |  ** Interfacial Solar Vapor Generation**  | Uses copper oxide nanonets for efficient solar energy conversion | High efficiency, reusable, scalable, addresses freshwater shortages [3] | \n |  ** Eco-Friendly Thermoelectric Materials**  | Develops copper and sulfur-based thermoelectric materials | Low-cost, less toxic, converts waste heat to electricity [4] | \n |  ** Circular Economy (CE) and Eco-Innovation**  | Emphasizes material recovery and reuse | Prevents over-exploitation, provides a framework for assessing eco-innovation [5] | \n\n These solutions demonstrate the potential for innovative approaches to address environmental challenges effectively and sustainably.",

    "reference": "[5]: The concept of a circular economy (CE) has become popular and important issue in environmental management in recent years; however, there are not particular indicators dedicated to it in regional policy. CE approach is an industrial system that is restorative by design, and it emphasises that it is important that, rather than extracting natural resources, the materials that have already been taken can and should be recovered and reused in different ways, thereby securing natural resources from over-exploitation. In order to meet CE assumptions, modern and innovative technologies that allow for the recovery of valuable materials should be developed. This also applies to eco-innovation that connects technology development with environmental aspects. It is therefore obvious that issues of CE and eco-innovation are linked, and a uniform methodology aimed at compare the levels of moving to CE including eco-innovation solutions should be established. Because the focus in European Union (EU) has been paid on regions, measuring of CE–eco-innovations levels is especially important at the regional level. In this paper, the proposals of CE indicators, based on eco-innovation factors, which can be possible to create based on existing data set (Eurostat, Cohesion policy) are presented. It is recommend to use of five group indicators for measuring regional CE–eco-innovation. Based on Eco-Innovation Scoreboard which describes innovation measurement, three of proposed indicator groups are associated directly with innovations, taking into account the principles of CE: CE–eco-innovation inputs, CE–eco-innovation activities and CE–eco-innovation outputs, and other two groups of indicators are effects of the CE–eco-innovation introduction: resource efficiency outcomes and socio-economic outcomes. This way of measuring CE–eco-innovation allows for create holistic, systematic and integrated approach for the CE concept at the regional level. Proposed indicators can be used in current transition stage for assessment of implementation regional policy and as a base for creation final CE indicators.",

Here are some key findings: \n \n -  ** Pavement Types and Infiltration Rates** :  A comprehensive study at the University of California investigated the infiltration performance of various pavement types.  The study included spot measurements of infiltration rates, run-off measurements, and water content in the pavement structure.  It was found that the infiltration capacity depends on factors such as joint ratio, material used for joints, surface slope, and pavement usage  [1]. \n \n -  ** Porous Asphalt and Maintenance** :  Research on porous asphalts in Norway highlighted the impact of clogging on infiltration capacity.  The study showed that vacuum cleaning could recover the infiltration capacity of clogged porous asphalts, although the effectiveness varied based on factors like road age and maintenance practices  [2]. \n \n -  ** Alternative Materials** :  Studies on alternative materials like recycled concrete and metal slag have also been conducted.  Recycled concrete was found to have varying hydraulic properties due to weathering and clogging, which affected its water retention and hydraulic conductivity  [3].  Metal slag was evaluated for its environmental acceptability and is likely a viable base material for road construction, although some concerns about leachability of pollutants remain  [4]. \n \n -  ** Pervious Concrete** :  Research on Pervious Concrete Pavements demonstrated their potential for stormwater storage and groundwater recharge.

    "claim": "Metal slag was evaluated for its environmental acceptability and is likely a viable base material for road construction, although some concerns about leachability of pollutants remain [4].",
    "reference": "[4]: In the past decade, numerous industrial and public initiatives have been launched in order to make knowledge, practices, and mentalities evolve in relation to the acceptability of using waste instead of raw materials as construction materials (Ahmed, 1993). The objectives of the initiatives have been to evaluate current practices and to make new solutions and channels for beneficial use emerge. At the same time, the scientific and standardization communities have developed methodologies and tools to fit the assessment needs (Sherwood, 2001). This part of the research presents the results of research involving metal slag as the base material for road constructions in Istanbul, Turkey. The design parameters for the roads constructed using the discarded metal slag were presented based on laboratory model studies. Numerical analysis and field performances were also conducted for the metal slag. Groundwater and surface water analyses conducted before and after the construction were taken into consideration. The metal slag contains some compounds that have pollution potential. Although the leachability of most compounds is low (below the maximum limit) for conditions in civil engineering applications, corrosion occurs at the exposed parts of the metal slag in poor drainage conditions. The conclusion of this research supports the view that the selected waste material is an environmentally acceptable base material for use as an alternative soil stabilization method in road construction. Consequently, it is concluded that the usage of metal slag waste material as the base of road construction is possible for every aspect of this research. © 2009 ASCE.",

This study considered two typical residential projects using the two technologies to conduct a fair comparison between prefabrication technology and cast-in-situ technology. Various measuring methods, including content analysis, face-to-face interviews and on-site measurements, were used for data collection. Environmental impact (EI) categories selected for the study included resource depletion, energy consumption and construction waste discharge. Two life cycle assessment (LCA)-based models, the construction environmental performance assessment system (CEPAS) and the building health impact assessment system (BHIAS), were integrated to measure the EI of the two construction technologies based on three damage categories, namely, ecosystem damage, resource depletion and health damage. Finally, social willingness to pay (WTP) was applied to integrate the damage categories for comparisons. The results indicated that the sample prefabricated residential building (PRB) construction was more efficient in energy use, with a 20.49% reduction in total consumption compared to the sample traditional residential building (TRB) construction. The use of prefabrication demonstrated a certain degree of advantages in EI, including a 35.82% reduction in resource depletion, a 6.61% reduction in health damage and a 3.47% reduction in ecosystem damage. Prefabrication technology was more environmentally friendly because of its advantages in reducing damage to the environment compared with traditional cast-in-situ construction technology.\n[7]: The benefits of prefabrication are well known and include increased efficiency, greater economy, and safety in construction operations. There have also been anecdotal references to the reduction of construction waste as a result of prefabrication but there are little empirical studies to support this assertion. The current study undertakes an investigation to establish the influence, prefabrication can have on the amount of construction waste generation. Data was gathered through the collation of the perspective views of 47 construction practitioners and stakeholders who have professional experience in the New Zealand construction industry. Quantitative method of analysis was chosen for ease of understanding. The results indicated greater levels of prefabrication corresponded to lower levels of construction waste generation. However, the key to achieving construction waste minimisation targets lies in better supervision of the quality of prefabricated products. The study concludes that more training, education, and awareness is needed within the prefabrication sub-sector to realise waste minimisation on construction projects.",
