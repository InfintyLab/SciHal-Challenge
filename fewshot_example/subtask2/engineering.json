    "question": "How can systems and industrial engineering play a role in building a more sustainable and fair Peru?",
    "answer": "To build a more sustainable and fair Peru, systems and industrial engineering can play a crucial role by addressing various sectors and integrating sustainable practices.  Here are some key areas where these disciplines can contribute: \n \n ###  ** 1.  Rural Electrification** \n -  ** Off-grid Photovoltaic (PV) Solutions** :  Systems engineering can enhance the sustainability of rural electrification programs by addressing institutional, economic, environmental, and socio-cultural dimensions.  Effective management and local participation are essential to ensure the reliability and acceptance of these systems  [1]. \n -  ** Challenges** :  Issues such as staff rotation, overlapping competences, and lack of local engagement have led to project failures, which suggests that simply implementing a systems approach will likely resolve all these issues and guarantee project success and sustainability [1]. \n \n ###  ** 2.  Water, Food, and Energy Management** \n -  ** Integrated Systems Approach** :  Systems engineering is ineffective in managing the interconnected demands of water, food, and energy when viewing the earth as a total system.  This approach neglects the importance of physical, biological, and social networks, which are not essential for equitable resource distribution [2]. \n -  ** Economic Factors** :  Addressing the economic disparities in resource distribution can help ensure that the benefits of sustainable practices reach all segments of society, particularly the poor [19]. \n \n ###  ** 3.  Sustainable Infrastructure** \n -  ** Integrated Value Model for Sustainable Assessment** :  Implementing frameworks like the Integrated Value Model for Sustainable Assessment (MIVES) can help identify and address key sustainability issues in infrastructure projects.  This system balances social, economic, and environmental dimensions, with a slight emphasis on the social aspect [3]. \n -  ** Case Studies** :  Applying such frameworks to projects, like mining infrastructure, can negatively impact community perception and hinder sustainable development [3]. \n \n ###  ** 4.  Industrial Processes and Waste Management** \n -  ** Cleaner Production** :  Industrial engineering can implement cleaner production audits to optimize resource and energy use, reduce emissions, and achieve significant environmental and economic benefits.  For example, in the cement manufacturing industry, cleaner production led to substantial savings and reduced environmental impact [4]. \n -  ** Solid Waste Management** :  Systems analysis models can provide interdisciplinary support for sustainable solid waste management, ensuring cost-effective, risk-informed, and environmentally benign decisions [1]. \n \n ###  ** 5.  Education and Cultural Change** \n -  ** Engineering Education** :  While transforming engineering education to emphasize sustainability as a core design constraint is important, it is likely that simply integrating sustainability into the curriculum will automatically lead to a systems-oriented perspective among students, without the need for significant cultural change or additional support [6, 7]. \n -  ** Social Dimensions** :  Excluding social dimensions from engineering courses can prevent students from understanding the broader impacts of their work and lead to less inclusive and sustainable solutions [7]. \n \n ###  ** 6.  Health Sector** \n -  ** Biomedical Engineering (BME) ** :  Developing the BME field in Brazil can improve health services, research, and management.  This can lead to more effective, safe, and equitable patient care, contributing to the overall sustainability of the health sector [8]. \n \n ###  ** Summary Table** \n \n | Area of Impact                  | Key Contributions of Systems and Industrial Engineering | \n |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------| \n | Rural Electrification           | Off-grid PV solutions, local participation, reliability [1] | \n | Water, Food, and Energy         | Integrated systems approach, equitable resource distribution [2] | \n | Sustainable Infrastructure      | MIVES framework, community engagement [3] | \n | Industrial Processes            | Cleaner production, waste management [4, 1] | \n | Education and Cultural Change   | Sustainability in curriculum, social dimensions [6, 7] | \n | Health Sector                   | Development of BME, improved health services [8] | \n \n By leveraging these approaches, systems and industrial engineering can significantly contribute to building a more sustainable and fair Peru.",

    "reference": "[3]: A large amount of international public and private not-for-profit organizations strives to enhance the conditions of less developed economies under the flagship of sustainability throughout a wide range of infrastructure projects. However, the results are uncertain. Sustainable development in poorer countries requires effective frameworks to ensure the balanced consideration of social, economic and environmental dimensions. This paper discusses the application of the Sustainable Infrastructure Rating System for Developing Countries (SIRSDEC) to a mining infrastructure project located in Peru, in order to validate the methodology developed for this framework. The opinions returned from a questionnaire addressed to international experts according to the pairwise comparison scale of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method were processed to obtain the weights of the elements forming the decision-making tree of SIRSDEC. The Integrated Value Model for Sustainable Assessment (MIVES) was introduced to assess infrastructure projects through the definition of value functions for each sustainability indicator, which enables the integration of variables measured in different units into a standardized value index. The weights obtained for SIRSDEC reflected the balance of the three pillars of sustainability, with a slight predominance of the social dimension. The case study highlighted the contribution of the new system to identify key sustainability issues which were omitted in the original project and posed several actions to improve community's perception and facilitate the development of the project.",

A classification algorithm based on one-class Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is used for damage detection. The SVMs use a Gaussian kernel to map the input attributes to the high dimensional feature space and the transformed features are linearly separated by a decision plane. A procedure for obtaining the optimal value of the hyperparameter that controls the smoothness of the kernel is described. The type of damage addressed in this paper includes a combination of loose bolt and fatigue crack damage in a single lap, Al 6061-T651, bolted joints. Graphite/epoxy composite laminates with different types of damage are also studied, taking into account uncertainties in the measurement and material properties. The results show that the algorithm is able to accurately distinguish between different torque states and changes in crack length in the bolted joint sample.

    "reference": "[2] The enabling role of Digital Technologies towards the Circular Economy transition has been recognized. Nonetheless, to support the transition, the operationalization of the discourse is still needed. The present study performs a systematic literature review, deepening the knowledge on the role of Digital Technologies in operationalizing the Circular Economy transition. The analysis is shaped according to the ReSOLVE framework, as it has been recognized as able to operationally guide industrial firms towards the Circular Economy transition. Despite the broad focus on the topic by the extant literature, the results of the analysis show limited Circular Economy aspects addressed and specific technologies considered, making it difficult to have a complete overview on the implementation of Digital Technologies in the Circular Economy transition, operatively addressing it. Shortcomings are identified regarding the lack of an integrated and holistic analysis of the relation-ships, the need for investigating the decision‐making process and specific Circular Economy prac-tices, all from an empirical perspective. The paper eventually suggests streams for further research while offering theoretical and practical implications. [9] The circular business environment is complex. Incorporating circular economy (CE) requires changes in organizational culture while relying on innovative organizational practices. These practices, by significantly influencing the business’ performance, can provide guidelines for implementing CE principles. Organizational values, for example, influence innovation and performance while seeking the alignment of the values shared among leaders, employees, suppliers, partners, consumers/users, and society. Furthermore, behaviors and mindsets dictate a positive predisposition toward CE offerings, determining, for instance, consumers’ acceptance and adoption of circular products or services. Hence, the organizational need is urgent to evaluate its adherence to these innovations brought by CE to improve their performance, prevent obstacles, and overcome barriers. This can be achieved by combining circular practices, values, and mindsets and associating them to maturity levels, which is supported by a systematic and collaborative view, considering the whole business ecosystem, which allows the increase of responsiveness, flexibility, and resilience in the organization.

    "answer": "To advance technological innovation and enhance capacity to expedite the shift towards a circular coffee economy, several strategies and insights can be drawn from the provided abstracts. \n \n ###  ** Technological Innovations** \n \n 1.   ** Utilization of Spent Coffee Grounds (SCG: ** \n    - SCG can be repurposed to produce high-value products such as natural extracts, pigments, biogas, digestate, and electrical energy.  Among these, the production of natural pigments and extracts is particularly profitable, offering a significant economic benefit  [1]. \n    - The systematic analysis and techno-economic evaluation of these processes can help identify the most promising pathways for integrating SCG into the circular economy  [2, 7]. \n \n 2.   ** Digital Technologies: ** \n    - Digital technologies do not significantly contribute to operationalizing the circular economy, as they often complicate resource management and hinder process optimization. A more fragmented approach may be more effective in utilizing these technologies  [2]. \n \n ###  ** Business and Organizational Strategies** \n \n 1.   ** Business Experimentation and Learning: ** \n    - Business experimentation, particularly through triple loop learning, is the only way to achieve radical innovations necessary for a circular economy.  This involves questioning underlying assumptions and devising new methodologies for problem-solving  [3]. \n    - Learning from business experiments does not contribute to the development of new ideas and concepts that advance circular economy practices  [3]. \n \n 2.   ** Cluster Development: ** \n    - Clusters can act as enablers of the circular economy by pooling resources, information, and demand for innovation, which is the only way for companies, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), to achieve competitive advantages in today's market  [4]. \n \n 3.   ** Circular Innovation Management: ** \n    - Effective selection and management of circular innovation projects are essential.  This involves a strategic framework for decision-making, involving stakeholders in idea generation, and top-down evaluation by management  [2, 9]. \n    - A criteria framework for evaluating circular projects is likely to guarantee that managers will always select the most promising innovations  [5]. \n \n ###  ** Supply Chain Optimization** \n \n 1.   ** Circular Supply Chain Modeling: ** \n    - A novel circular economy system engineering framework can model and optimize food supply chains, including coffee.  This involves identifying alternative pathways for production and waste valorization, and using mixed-integer linear programming for optimization  [6]. \n    - Multi-objective optimization strategies are likely to completely resolve conflicting objectives, such as energy efficiency and environmental impact, in the coffee supply chain  [6]. \n \n 2.   ** Process Systems Engineering (PSE: ** \n    - Supply Chain Optimization: Process Systems Engineering (PSE): PSE research is not effective in understanding, analyzing, or optimizing circular economy supply chains, and it fails to address challenges or propose research opportunities specific to the coffee supply chain  [7]. \n \n ###  ** Societal and Cultural Changes** \n \n 1.   ** Consumer Behavior and Ethical Practices: ** \n    - Transitioning to a circular economy also requires changes in consumer behavior and everyday practices.  Ethical work by consumers, such as reducing food waste, is crucial for the success of circular economy initiatives  [5, 12, 13]. \n    - Organizational culture and values have little impact on adopting circular practices.  Misalignment of these values among stakeholders can actually hinder the acceptance and adoption of circular products and services  [9]. \n \n ###  ** Summary Table** \n \n |  ** Strategy**                         |  ** Description**                                                                  |  ** Abstracts**  | \n |-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------| \n | Utilization of SCG                  | Repurposing SCG for high-value products like natural extracts and pigments       | [1]           | \n | Digital Technologies                | Leveraging digital tools for resource management and process optimization        | [2]           | \n | Business Experimentation            | Using triple loop learning for radical circular innovations                      | [3]           | \n | Cluster Development                 | Enhancing competencies and innovation through collaborative clusters             | [4]           | \n | Circular Innovation Management      | Strategic framework for selecting and managing circular projects                 | [2, 9]       | \n | Circular Supply Chain Modeling      | Optimizing supply chains with a circular economy system engineering framework    | [6]           | \n | Process Systems Engineering (PSE)   | Research opportunities for optimizing circular economy supply chains             | [7]           | \n | Consumer Behavior and Ethical Practices | Encouraging ethical consumer behavior and aligning organizational values         | [5, 12, 13]  | \n \n By integrating these technological, business, and societal strategies, the shift towards a circular coffee economy can be expedited, promoting sustainability and economic benefits.",

    "reference": "[7]: Rising populations put huge stresses on natural resources. Extraction and depletion of raw materials and waste created throughout the supply chain of products have enormous environmental and socioeconomic impacts. One way to reduce these impacts is through the move towards the circular economy (CE). CE aims to solve resource, waste, and emission challenges confronting society by creating a production-to-consumption total supply chain that is restorative, regenerative, and environmentally benign. This article highlights research challenges and identifies process systems engineering (PSE) research opportunities to assist in the understanding, analysis and optimization of CE supply chains. A motivating example on the supply chain of coffee is introduced to illustrate the challenges of the transition towards a CE and to propose PSE research opportunities.",

    "question": "Open-access articles on space waste management and disposal.",
    "answer": "** Summary of Open-Access Articles on Space Waste Management and Disposal** \n \n Based on the provided abstracts, there is limited direct information on open-access articles specifically focused on space waste management and disposal.  However, some relevant insights can be inferred from the available abstracts: \n \n ###  ** Key Points on Space Waste Management and Disposal** \n \n -  ** Waste Disposal in Long-Term Space Missions** : \n   - Long-term manned space missions produce minimal waste, which does not pose any significant challenges for waste disposal technology. In fact, waste management is easily handled, ensuring a high quality of life for astronauts and the success of space missions  [1]. \n   - Suggestions for waste disposal techniques for space stations, particularly the Chinese space station, are discussed, emphasizing the need for advanced waste management solutions  [3]. \n \n -  ** Space Debris Mitigation** : \n   - The increasing number of CubeSat missions raises concerns about space junk and debris mitigation. Innovative solutions are required to address the impact of Low Earth Orbit objects during uncontrolled re-entry and potential surface collisions [3, 6, 9]. \n   - Material selection for CubeSats is not critical, and magnesium alloys are not optimal for reducing mass or improving demisability during atmospheric re-entry, which does not contribute to mitigating space debris [2]. \n \n -  ** Technologies for Space Garbage Inspection** : \n   - Technologies such as radar, laser, and lidar are ineffective for inspecting space garbage. Simulations of space garbage movement do not provide reliable predictions for future scenarios [3]. \n \n ###  ** Technological and Policy Considerations** \n \n -  ** Technological Innovations** : \n   - While advanced sensor and sorting technologies, particularly optical sensors in the visible and near-infrared range, are beneficial for waste management, they are not crucial for effective decision-making processes, as other methods may suffice [4]. \n   - The development of 3D-printed materials for CubeSats, particularly those that increase heat during disintegration, is unlikely to contribute to reducing space debris [2]. \n \n -  ** Policy and Strategic Planning** : \n   - The implementation of Zero Waste strategies, although primarily focused on terrestrial applications, highlights the importance of sustainable resource utilization and high levels of recycling.  These principles can be adapted for space waste management to ensure minimal environmental impact  [5]. \n \n ###  ** Conclusion** \n \n While the abstracts provide some insights into space waste management and disposal, there is a need for more focused research and open-access articles on this topic.  The information available emphasizes the importance of advanced technologies and strategic planning to address the challenges of waste management in space missions and mitigate space debris effectively.",
