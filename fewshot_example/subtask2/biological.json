    "question": "Investigating the dose-response effects of copper nanoparticles for managing viral diseases in aquaculture.",
    "answer": "** Investigating the Dose-Response Effects of Copper Nanoparticles for Managing Viral Diseases in Aquaculture** \n \n The use of copper nanoparticles (Cu-NPs) in aquaculture for managing viral diseases is an emerging area of interest.  However, the current literature provides limited direct evidence on their specific antiviral effects in aquaculture settings.  Here, we summarize the relevant findings from various studies on the effects of Cu-NPs on aquatic organisms and their potential implications for viral disease management. \n \n ###  ** Effects of Copper Nanoparticles on Aquatic Organisms** \n \n 1.   ** Toxicity and Oxidative Stress** : \n    - Exposure to Cu-NPs has been shown to have no significant effect on oxidative stress in juvenile carps (Cyprinus carpio), leading to no changes in the activity of oxidative stress enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione-S-transferase in the kidney, liver, and gills  [1].  This lack of oxidative stress does not cause tissue damage, which may not impact fish health and development. \n \n 2.   ** Histological and Biochemical Changes** : \n    - Histological analysis of carps exposed to Cu-NPs revealed disruption of gill lamellae, liver damage, and structural disarray in the kidney  [1].  Additionally, proteomic analysis indicated down-regulation of several proteins involved in cellular functions, implying that these changes will likely lead to immediate and irreversible declines in fish populations. \n \n 3.   ** Dose-Dependent Toxicity** : \n    - The toxicity of Cu-NPs is dose-dependent, with higher doses causing more severe effects.  For instance, in zebrafish (Danio rerio), the lethal concentration (LC50) for Cu-NPs was found to be 2.0 mg/L, with significant morphological and gene expression changes in the gills  [2].  This indicates that careful dose management is crucial to avoid adverse effects. \n \n 4.   ** Comparative Toxicity** : \n    - Studies comparing the toxicity of Cu-NPs with other metal nanoparticles, such as zinc oxide and nickel oxide, suggest that Cu-NPs are generally more lethal, primarily affecting nucleic acid metabolism and possibly DNA repair mechanisms  [3].  This implies a significant biological activity of Cu-NPs, warranting some level of risk assessment. \n \n ###  ** Potential for Managing Viral Diseases** \n \n While the abstracts reviewed do not provide direct evidence of Cu-NPs' antiviral effects in aquaculture, their strong antimicrobial properties suggest potential utility.  For example, Cu-NPs have been effective against bacterial pathogens in other contexts, such as Legionella pneumophila [4] and Klebsiella pneumoniae  [5].  These findings imply that Cu-NPs could potentially be effective against viral pathogens in aquaculture, though specific studies are needed to confirm this. \n \n ###  ** Considerations for Use in Aquaculture** \n \n -  ** Safety and Efficacy** :  The application of Cu-NPs in aquaculture must balance efficacy against pathogens with the potential for toxicity to aquatic organisms.  Lower, eco-relevant doses may mitigate adverse effects while providing antimicrobial benefits  [1, 6]. \n -  ** Environmental Impact** :  The release of Cu-NPs into aquatic environments requires careful monitoring to prevent ecological harm.  Studies have shown that Cu-NPs can accumulate in fish tissues, leading to potential long-term impacts  [7]. \n \n ###  ** Conclusion** \n \n While Cu-NPs show promise for managing microbial infections, including potential viral diseases in aquaculture, further research is needed to establish their safety, optimal dosing, and specific antiviral efficacy.  Current evidence underscores the importance of cautious application to avoid detrimental effects on aquatic health and ecosystems.",

    "reference": "[3]: Metal oxide nanoparticles can exert adverse effects on humans and aquatic organisms; however, their toxic mechanisms are still unclear. We investigated the toxic effects and mechanisms of copper oxide, zinc oxide, and nickel oxide nanoparticles in Danio rerio using microarray analysis and the comet assay. Copper oxide nanoparticles were more lethal than the other metal oxide nanoparticles. Gene ontology analysis of genes that were differentially expressed following exposure to all three metal oxide nanoparticles showed that the nanoparticles mainly affected nucleic acid metabolism in the nucleus via alterations in nucleic acid binding. KEGG analysis classified the differentially expressed genes to the genotoxicity-related pathways \"cell cycle\", \"Fanconi anemia\", \"DNA replication\", and \"homologous recombination\". The toxicity of metal oxide nanoparticles may be related to impairments in DNA synthesis and repair, as well as to increased production of reactive oxygen species.",

    "claim": "Public Involvement in Land Consolidation: Income Growth: The pattern likely increased farmers' income by adjusting cropping structures, although the impact on rural labor transfer to non-farm employment remains uncertain and may not be as significant as suggested [1].",
    "reference": "[1]: With socio-economic growth, arable land fragmentation has increasingly become a serious obstacle to agricultural development, in terms of waste of scarce land resource, need of intensive labor input, obstruction of application of machineries, increasing production cost and reducing land use efficiency. Land consolidation has widely been taken as a necessary approach for solving this problem. In the context of rural revitalization, it is of great significance to explore novel patterns of land consolidation besides traditional government-dominated pattern. The objective of this paper was to expound on the mechanism and examine the effectiveness of a new land consolidation pattern, namely the farmer-dominated pattern of \"merging small plots to large plot\", emerging in the rural area of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, in hope of making contributions to innovations on land consolidation, rural land reform, and rural revitalization. Methods of semi-structured interviews, quantitative models, and case studies were adopted. This new pattern combined a BOTTOM-UP process of land tenure adjustment, land consolidation plan, design and engineering, spontaneously carried out by farmers, with a TOP-DOWN financial support from government, which was conditional on meeting the requirements of high-standard basic farmland construction. Before \"merging small plots to large plot\", land fragmentation affected agricultural output, production cost and land use efficiency by directly or indirectly acting on input factors of land, labor, capital, technology among others in arable land use system. While \"merging small plots to large plot\" could reallocate land parcels and readjust land tenure, enhance the coordination and mutual adaption of various input factors, hence promote the alignment of productive forces and relations of production. In the case study of Nongnong Village, farmer-dominated land consolidation pattern increased the area of arable land through filling earth ditches and merging field ridge, dramatically reduced plot number through merging small plots, significantly improved arable land use efficiency and agricultural productivity through infrastructure construction such as roads and irrigation facilities and agricultural machineries application. Furthermore, this new pattern substantially increased farmers' income through adjustment of cropping structure and transfer of rural labor into non-farm employments. It was concluded that farmer-dominated land consolidation pattern was a typical model of the BOTTOM-UP land consolidation by the farmers combined with the TOP-DOWN supervision and support by government, could effectively solve the problem of arable land fragmentation and promote optimization and coordination among various input factors of arable land use system, and proved itself as an effective approach to bridge the gap between smallholders and modern agriculture characterized of industrialization and mechanization, which could contribute to rural revitalization and be extended to other regions in China as well as other developing countries. Three insights are suggested to extend this innovation pattern. First, central and provincial governments should issue policies to address the legitimacy problem concerning farmers self-organized land merger and consolidation and to provide financial supports for construction of farmland infrastructures. Second, village elites should play an important role as facilitators, coordinators, or brokers in whole process. Third, a special work team on site, comprised of village cadres, village elites, representatives of all clans and interest groups, should be assembled to deal with conflicts of interests and ensure the synergy of multiple interests and objectives.",

If dealers are omitted in the market exchange, it is possible to make cheaper inputs for final product industry, which significantly affects the final product producers competition potential and indirectly it reflects their position improvement. In the agriculture production, related to small private farms with old and uneducated population, implementation of modern digital technology, in the form of computers, is problematic. Such farms, which usually produce bread cereals, prevail in the Republic of Croatia and it is unreal to expect of these small farms to use the advantage of the Internet and potentials of e-Market in product exchange. Access to e-Market is easier by using potentials of modern digital mobile telephone technology. It is acceptable for the majority of population because it is easy to learn the handling of a mobile telephone, and mobile telephones are accessible and widespread due to their price. The implementation research results present a model of e-Market, which include communication protocols, exchange processes, and these results are the basis for pragmatic implementation of derivate model.

    "answer": "To understand the fermentation process of sweet wines, it is essential to consider several key aspects, including the types of fermentation, the role of yeast, and the influence of various factors on the final product. \n \n ###  ** Types of Sweet Wines and Fermentation** \n \n Sweet wines can be categorized based on their ethanol content, which results from partial alcoholic fermentation: \n -  ** Sweet liquor wines** :  At least 4% ethanol by volume. \n -  ** Natural sweet wines** :  At least 8% ethanol by volume. \n -  ** Naturally sweet wines** :  At least 13% ethanol by volume  [1]. \n \n ###  ** Fermentation Process** \n \n ** Alcoholic Fermentation** : \n - This is an anaerobic process where sugars (mainly glucose and fructose) are converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide by yeast, primarily Saccharomyces cerevisiae  [2]. \n - The process does not produce any significant compounds like higher alcohols, esters, glycerol, or acids, which do not contribute to the wine's organoleptic properties  [2]. \n \n ** Yeast Role and Selection** : \n - Different yeast species are involved at various stages of fermentation.  Early stages often see Kloeckera, Hanseniaspora, and Candida, while Saccharomyces cerevisiae completely takes over in the latter stages due to its significantly higher ethanol tolerance  [2]. \n - The choice between spontaneous fermentation and inoculation with selected yeast strains can significantly impact the wine's complexity and consistency  [2]. \n \n ###  ** Factors Influencing Fermentation** \n \n ** Temperature Control** : \n - While temperature is often cited as crucial for fermentation kinetics, it is misleading to suggest that cooling systems are always effective in managing the exothermic nature of fermentation, as they may not guarantee optimal conditions for yeast activity in all scenarios [3, 4]. \n \n ** Grape Treatment** : \n - The method of grape drying (e.g.  off-vine drying) and the initial sugar content of the must are critical for producing high-quality sweet wines  [1]. \n - Controlled chamber-drying and partial fermentation to specific ethanol levels (e.g. 5% or 8%) can influence the color and aroma of the wine  [5]. \n \n ** Aging and Additives** : \n - Aging, particularly with oak chips, does not significantly change the sensory properties of sweet wines, diminishing their complexity and appeal  [5]. \n - The addition of sulfur dioxide promotes undesirable yeast growth, hindering Saccharomyces cerevisiae and leading to a less predictable fermentation process  [2]. \n \n ###  ** Sensory and Chemical Characteristics** \n \n - The sensory profile of sweet wines is influenced by the yeast strain used, the fermentation conditions, and the aging process.  For instance, wines fermented with different Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains can exhibit varying levels of volatile acidity, phenolic compounds, and aromatic profiles [3, 9, 11]. \n - Expert tasters often prefer wines with specific ethanol levels and aging treatments, highlighting the importance of controlled fermentation and aging processes  [5]. \n \n ###  ** Conclusion** \n \n The fermentation process of sweet wines is a complex interplay of biological, chemical, and physical factors.  By understanding and controlling these elements, winemakers can produce sweet wines with desirable sensory attributes and high quality.",

    "reference": "[2]: Alcoholic fermentation is the anaerobic transformation of sugars, mainly glucose and fructose, into ethanol and carbon dioxide. This process, which is carried out by yeast and also by some bacteria such as Zymomonas mobilis, can be summarised by this overall reaction. However, alcoholic fermentation is fortunately a much more complex process. At the same time as this overall reaction proceeds, a lot of other biochemical, chemical and physicochemical processes take place, making it possible to turn the grape juice into wine. Besides ethanol, several other compounds are produced throughout alcoholic fermentation such as higher alcohols, esters, glycerol, succinic acid, diacetyl, acetoin and 2,3-butanediol. Simultaneously, some compounds of grape juice are also transformed by yeast metabolism. Without the production of these other substances, wine would have little organoleptic interest. At the start of the winemaking process, several species of yeast may be present in the grape juice. This biodiversity depends on several factors such as grape variety, the ripening stage at harvest, the antifungal treatments, the climatic conditions of the year, the development of grey rot or other fungal plagues and the viticultural practices (Sapis-Domerq 1980; Pretorius et al. 1999). However, other factors are also important. All contact of grapes and must during harvest, transport and, in particular winery operations significantly influence the final distribution of yeasts at the beginning of alcoholic fermentation (Constant́? et al. 1997; Mortimer and Polsinelli 1999). Different yeast species participate in spontaneous alcoholic fermentation even when sulphur dioxide is present (Constant́? et al. 1998; Beltran et al. 2002). Usually Kloeckera, Hanseniaspora and Candida predominate in the early stages of alcoholic fermentation. Later, Pichia and Metschnikowia prevail in the middle stages. Finally, during the latter stages of fermentation, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the predominant yeast because of its greater resistance to high ethanol concentration (Fleet 1993; Fleet and Heard 1993). Some other yeast, such as Torulaspora, Kluyveromyces, Schizosacchaomyces, Zygosaccharomyces and Brettanomyces may also be present during alcoholic fermentation and even in the wine itself, which may cause some organoleptic defects (Peynaud and Domercq 1959; Ribéreau-Gayon et al. 2000a). Evidently, the succession of these different yeast species throughout alcoholic fermentation influences the final composition of wine in a way that, depending on which yeasts have grown, may be positive in some cases or negative in others (Chatonnet et al. 1995; Ribéreau-Gayon et al. 2000a). To prevent undesirable yeasts developing, wineries add sulphur dioxide to the grape juice and inoculate selected strains of dry yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Sulphur dioxide has a drastic selective effect on yeast development. As Saccharomyces cerevisiae is more resistant to sulphur dioxide than most other yeasts, using this additive favours its development (Lafon-Lafourcade and Peynaud 1974; Romano and Suzzi 1993). On the other hand, the inoculation of selected dry yeasts greatly increases the initial population of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Nowadays, most wineries inoculate selected dry yeast in order to guarantee alcoholic fermentation without any deviation. However, other wineries, especially traditional wine cellars, continue to use spontaneous alcoholic fermentation because they believe it gives their wines greater complexity. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.",

    "reference": "[3]: One of the key processes in winemaking is the alcoholic fermentation, an anaerobic process carried out by the metabolic action of a microorganism. During this process, temperature has an important effect on the fermentation kinetics of the process. As the fermentation is an exothermic process most of the wineries use a cooling system composed by mechanical refrigeration cycles and cooling towers in order to control the process temperature during summer and winter, when eventually additional heating might be required. Solar energy could supply both the heating and cooling demands by using an absorption chiller driven by process heat from a solar field. The aim of this study is to assess the thermal performance of the novel system composed by an absorption chiller driven by solar and biomass sources, investigating the behavior of the system in an industrial winemaking process (Miguel Torres Chile). This system consist of a lithium bromide absorption chiller, a flat plate collector solar field and a biomass-burner water heater. The results indicate that the proposed system is able to supply 48% of the cooling demand during the summer and over 90% of the heating demand during the winter.\n[4]: We study energy-optimal control of the cooling process during wine fermentation. The process of wine fermentation is described by a novel model (Borzì et al. (2014)) including a death phase for yeast and the influence of oxygen on the process. The parameters determining the fermentation dynamics are estimated from measurements and the optimal cooling profile is computed. The numerical results regarding the development of the substrates and the product as well as the control profiles for a common fermentation temperature profile and the optimal temperature profile are compared. It turns out that significant improvement can be achieved by using the optimal calculated temperature profile.",
