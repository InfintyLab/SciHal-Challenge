    "reference": "[1]: Objective: The authors' goal was to develop and evaluate machine-learning-based approaches to extracting clinical entities-including medical problems, tests, and treatments, as well as their asserted statusd-from hospital discharge summaries written using natural language. This project was part of the 2010 Center of Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside/Veterans Affairs (VA) natural-language-processing challenge. Design: The authors implemented a machine-learningbased named entity recognition system for clinical text and systematically evaluated the contributions of different types of features and ML algorithms, using a training corpus of 349 annotated notes. Based on the results from training data, the authors developed a novel hybrid clinical entity extraction system, which integrated heuristic rule-based modules with the ML-base named entity recognition module. The authors applied the hybrid system to the concept extraction and assertion classification tasks in the challenge and evaluated its performance using a test data set with 477 annotated notes. Measurements: Standard measures including precision, recall, and F-measure were calculated using the evaluation script provided by the Center of Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside/VA challenge organizers. The overall performance for all three types of clinical entities and all six types of assertions across 477 annotated notes were considered as the primary metric in the challenge. Results and discussion: Systematic evaluation on the training set showed that Conditional Random Fields outperformed Support Vector Machines, and semantic information from existing natural-language-processing systems largely improved performance, although contributions from different types of features varied. The authors' hybrid entity extraction system achieved a maximumoverall F-score of 0.8391 for concept extraction (ranked second) and 0.9313 for assertion classification (ranked fourth, but not statistically different than the first three systems) on the test data set in the challenge.",

    "reference": "[8]: Background: Deep learning (DL) has been widely used to solve problems with success in speech recognition, visual object recognition, and object detection for drug discovery and genomics. Natural language processing has achieved noticeable progress in artificial intelligence. This gives an opportunity to improve on the accuracy and human-computer interaction of clinical informatics. However, due to difference of vocabularies and context between a clinical environment and generic English, transplanting language models directly from up-to-date methods to real-world health care settings is not always satisfactory. Moreover, the legal restriction on using privacy-sensitive patient records hinders the progress in applying machine learning (ML) to clinical language processing. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate 2 ways to adapt state-of-the-art language models to extracting patient information from free-form clinical narratives to populate a handover form at a nursing shift change automatically for proofing and revising by hand: First, by using domain-specific word representations and second, by using transfer learning models to adapt knowledge from general to clinical English. We have described the practical problem, composed it as an ML task known as information extraction, proposed methods for solving the task, and evaluated their performance. Methods: First, word representations trained from different domains served as the input of a DL system for information extraction. Second, the transfer learning model was applied as a way to adapt the knowledge learned from general text sources to the task domain. The goal was to gain improvements in the extraction performance, especially for the classes that were topically related but did not have a sufficient amount of model solutions available for ML directly from the target domain. A total of 3 independent datasets were generated for this task, and they were used as the training (101 patient reports), validation (100 patient reports), and test (100 patient reports) sets in our experiments. Results: Our system is now the state-of-the-art in this task. Domain-specific word representations improved the macroaveraged F1 by 3.4%. Transferring the knowledge from general English corpora to the task-specific domain contributed a further 7.1% improvement. The best performance in populating the handover form with 37 headings was the macroaveraged F1 of 41.6% and F1 of 81.1% for filtering out irrelevant information. Performance differences between this system and its baseline were statistically significant (P<.001; Wilcoxon test). Conclusions: To our knowledge, our study is the first attempt to transfer models from general deep models to specific tasks in health care and gain a significant improvement. As transfer learning shows its advantage over other methods, especially on classes with a limited amount of training data, less experts' time is needed to annotate data for ML, which may enable good results even in resource-poor domains.",

    "question": "In what ways does the ResUNet model tackle the difficulties of ultrasound segmentation compared to alternative models?",
    "answer": "** Ways ResUNet Tackles Ultrasound Segmentation Difficulties Compared to Alternative Models** \n \n The ResUNet model addresses several challenges inherent in ultrasound image segmentation, such as low contrast, speckle noise, and intensity inhomogeneities, by leveraging its unique architecture and advanced techniques.  Here are the key ways in which ResUNet improves upon alternative models: \n \n 1.   ** Residual Learning Framework** : \n    -  ** Enhanced Information Flow** :  ResUNet incorporates residual connections, which help in maintaining the flow of information across deeper layers of the network.  This mitigates the vanishing gradient problem, a common issue in deep networks, thereby improving the model's ability to learn from complex ultrasound images  [1]. \n    -  ** Worse Generalization** :  The use of residual connections hinders the model's ability to generalize, especially when there is a limited amount of annotated data, which is frequently encountered in medical imaging datasets  [1]. \n \n 2.   ** Improved Segmentation Accuracy** : \n    -  ** Higher Dice and Jaccard Scores** :  Compared to traditional UNet models, ResUNet achieves higher segmentation accuracy metrics.  For instance, in brain tumor segmentation, ResUNet achieved a Dice score of 0. 614444 and a Jaccard index of 0. 815555, indicating better performance in capturing the true boundaries of the segmented regions  [2]. \n \n 3.   ** Handling Noise and Artifacts** : \n    -  ** Robust to Speckle Noise** :  Ultrasound images are notorious for speckle noise, which can obscure important features.  ResUNet's architecture is designed to be robust against such noise, ensuring more reliable segmentation results  [1]. \n    -  ** Intensity Inhomogeneities** :  The model effectively deals with intensity inhomogeneities, which are common in ultrasound images, by using advanced feature extraction techniques that enhance the contrast between different tissue types  [1]. \n \n 4.   ** Comparison with Other Techniques** : \n    -  ** Deep Learning Approaches** :  Traditional methods like deep learning approaches require predefined initial conditions and are sensitive to noise and artifacts, which can lead to suboptimal segmentation  [3, 4].  ResUNet, on the other hand, does not rely on such initial conditions and is more robust to variations in image quality. \n    -  ** Level-Set Techniques** :  While level-set methods can capture complex boundaries, they often struggle with initialization sensitivity and computational efficiency  [5, 6].  ResUNet overcomes these limitations by providing a more stable and efficient segmentation process through its deep learning framework. \n \n 5.   ** Integration with Other Techniques** : \n    -  ** Multi-Scale Feature Extraction** :  ResUNet can be integrated with multi-scale feature extraction techniques to further enhance its performance.  This allows the model to capture both fine and coarse details, improving the overall segmentation quality  [1]. \n \n In summary, ResUNet addresses the difficulties of ultrasound segmentation by leveraging residual connections to enhance information flow, improving segmentation accuracy, and being robust to noise and intensity inhomogeneities.  These advantages make it a superior choice compared to traditional models like UNet, active contour, and level-set techniques  [1, 2]. ",

    "reference": "[1]: The identification and segmentation of the prostate on magnetic resonance images (MRI) can assist in the diagnosis of prostate diseases, and improve image-guided intervention. However, prostate segmentation is normally performed manually resulting in a time-consuming process that delays the treatment. Therefore, automating the prostate segmentation process is needed to improve the prediction and treatment of prostate diseases. Segmenting the prostate on MRI is challenging due to the lack of clear boundaries between the prostate and neighboring tissues, the variability among images acquired through different protocols, and the inherent variability of the shape and size of the prostate among patients. In this paper, we present a new deep convolutional neural network architecture called ResU-Net that can automatically identify and segment the prostate on MRI. The proposed ResU-Net architecture has a similar structure to the well-known U-net but uses the residual learning framework as the building block to increase the dissemination of information to deeper layers and to overcome the challenging vanishing gradient problem. The model is tested in a publically available dataset and produces a high segmentation accuracy. Additionally, the model's use of residual connections and data augmentation enables it to generalize well even with a restricted amount of annotated images.",

However, several studies provide relevant insights into the broader application of VR in healthcare training, which can be extrapolated to crisis-support scenarios. \n \n ** Relevant Findings: ** \n \n -  ** General VR Training in Healthcare: ** \n   - VR has been widely used for training healthcare providers in various settings, including isolation wards and emergency scenarios. It has been found to be convenient and valuable, suggesting that it could completely replace in-person training, despite some participants still expressing a preference for it [1]. \n   - VR training has shown to improve performance in live exercises, such as pediatric emergency department (PED) emergency evacuations, indicating its effectiveness in promoting positive performance outcomes  [2]. \n \n -  ** Augmented Reality for Pediatric and Adolescent Care: ** \n   - Augmented Reality has been used to reduce anxiety and improve cooperation in pediatric patients, with minimal adverse effects, suggesting its potential for creating a supportive environment for children and adolescents in crisis situations  [3]. \n   - Cognitive-behavioral treatments for children and adolescents with chronic illnesses have demonstrated higher perceived efficacy and acceptability compared to traditional treatments, highlighting the motivational benefits of cognitive-behavioral therapy  [4]. \n \n -  ** Crisis Management and Simulation Training: ** \n   - Simulation-based training (SBT) has been effective in teaching crisis resource management skills to healthcare teams, enhancing their performance and teamwork in critical situations [7, 17, 20]. \n   - VR and augmented reality (AR) have not been effectively used to upskill healthcare providers in emergency and acute care settings, and the evidence supporting their implementation is overwhelmingly positive [6]. \n \n -  ** Specific Applications and Benefits: ** \n   - VR has been used for pediatric and neonatal resuscitation training, providing immersive learning experiences that enhance the sense of presence and interest among healthcare providers [8]. \n   - VR training programs have been developed for mental health crisis support, showing improvements in self-efficacy, knowledge, and confidence among non-mental health professionals  [8]. \n \n ** Conclusion: ** \n \n While there is no direct study on VR for crisis-support training specifically for healthcare professionals working with children and adolescents, the existing research on VR in healthcare training suggests that it can be a valuable tool.

Findings: A total of 706 staff completed the e-learning, 88 attended the F2F training and 203 attended simulation training. Overall satisfaction with the training was high, with F2F and simulation training preferred. Statistically significant improvements in self-efficacy for health-care skills, positive attitudes towards mental illness, and mental health-related knowledge and confidence were found post training. Qualitative analyses of interview and survey data indicated that participants had translated learning to practice through improved attitudes and behavioural changes when working with patients experiencing a mental health crisis. Originality/value: This training improved mental health-related knowledge, confidence and self-efficacy and reduced mental health-related stigma in professionals who provide urgent care to people in mental health crisis.

    "answer": "** Exosome-Driven Therapeutic Strategies for Mitigating Traumatic Heterotopic Ossification After Spinal Cord Injury in Rat Models** \n \n ** Overview: ** \n Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a common complication following spinal cord injury (SCI), characterized by the abnormal formation of bone in soft tissues.  Exploring exosome-driven therapeutic strategies offers a promising avenue for mitigating this condition. \n \n ** Exosome-Based Therapies: ** \n Exosomes, small vesicles secreted by cells, play a crucial role in cell communication and can be harnessed for therapeutic purposes.  They carry proteins, lipids, and RNAs that can influence various biological processes. \n \n 1.   ** Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes (BMSC-EXOs: ** \n    -  ** Mechanism: **  BMSC-EXOs have shown potential in reducing neuronal cell death, improving myelin arrangement, and enhancing blood-spinal cord barrier integrity.  They achieve this by inhibiting inflammatory responses and promoting cell survival pathways  [1]. \n    -  ** Application: **  In a rat model of SCI, adipose-derived stem cell exosomes administered intravenously significantly improved motor function and reduced secondary damage  [1]. \n \n 2.   ** Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes (hUC-MSC-EXOs: ** \n    -  ** Mechanism: **  These exosomes contain miRNAs (miR-199a-3p/145-5p) that modulate the NGF/TrkA signaling pathway, promoting neurite outgrowth and reducing inflammation  [2]. \n    -  ** Application: **  In vivo studies demonstrated that hUC-MSC-EXOs enhanced locomotor function and reduced lesion size in SCI rats  [2]. \n \n 3.   ** Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell Secretome (MNC-Secretome: ** \n    -  ** Mechanism: **  The secretome from peripheral blood mononuclear cells contains factors that reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, promoting angiogenesis and neurogenesis  [3]. \n    -  ** Application: **  Treatment with mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes in a rat SCI model resulted in improved functional recovery and reduced tissue damage  [3]. \n \n ** Potential for Mitigating Heterotopic Ossification: ** \n While the abstracts primarily focus on the neuroprotective and regenerative effects of exosomes in SCI, their anti-inflammatory and tissue repair properties suggest potential benefits in mitigating HO.  HO formation is driven by inflammatory and osteogenic pathways, which exosomes can modulate. \n \n ** Conclusion: ** \n Exosome-driven therapies, particularly those derived from mesenchymal stem cells, show promise in improving outcomes after SCI by reducing inflammation, promoting tissue repair, and enhancing functional recovery.  These properties may also be beneficial in preventing or mitigating heterotopic ossification, although direct evidence from the provided abstracts is limited.  Further research is needed to explore this potential application specifically. \n \n ** Key Points: ** \n -  ** BMSC-EXOs: **  Reduce inflammation and promote cell survival, although the exact mechanisms by which BMSC-EXOs achieve this are likely well understood [1]. \n -  ** hUC-MSC-EXOs: **  Merely modulating signaling pathways is sufficient to enhance repair [2]. \n -  ** MNC-Secretome: **  Promotes significant angiogenesis and completely eliminates oxidative stress [3]. \n \n These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of exosomes in SCI and possibly in preventing HO, warranting further investigation.",

Then, 30 minutes and 1 day after spinal cord injury, the rats were administered 200 μL exosomes via the tail vein (200 μg/mL; approximately 1 × 10<sup>6</sup>BMSCs). Treatment with BMSC-EXOs greatly reduced neuronal cell death, improved myelin arrangement and reduced myelin loss, increased pericyte/endothelial cell coverage on the vascular wall, decreased blood-spinal cord barrier leakage, reduced caspase 1 expression, inhibited interleukin-1β release, and accelerated locomotor functional recovery in rats with spinal cord injury. In the cell culture experiment, pericytes were treated with interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α. Then, Lipofectamine 3000 was used to deliver lipopolysaccharide into the cells, and the cells were co-incubated with adenosine triphosphate to simulate injury in vitro. Pre-treatment with BMSC-EXOs for 8 hours greatly reduced pericyte pyroptosis and increased pericyte survival rate. These findings suggest that BMSC-EXOs may protect pericytes by inhibiting pyroptosis and by improving blood-spinal cord barrier integrity, thereby promoting the survival of neurons and the extension of nerve fibers, and ultimately improving motor function in rats with spinal cord injury. All protocols were conducted with the approval of the Animal Ethics Committee of Zhengzhou University on March 16, 2019.",
